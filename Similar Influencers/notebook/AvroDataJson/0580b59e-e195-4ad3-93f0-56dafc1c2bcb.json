Plus, I had seen so many amazing reviews calling it dark, disturbing, but extremely addicting. And even though I had those forewarnings, it still took me by surprise!\n\nThe story follows Shay, who\u2019s best friend from college (Laurel) has just died, forcing her to team up with her childhood friend and current podcaster, Jamie, to face the dark past from her college days.\n\nFrom the start, I was hooked. Then as the story progressed, I was even more invested. We primarily follow Shay in the present as she and Jamie work together to figure out what really happened to Laurel because with Shay\u2019s knowledge of past happenings and Jamie\u2019s true crime and journalistic expertise, they both sensed something strange happened. But, we also get flashbacks through Shay\u2019s words and slowly, the truth of what happened in college comes out. Now, this is where things took that dark twist and it made me sad that these young women were manipulated in cruel ways, but also so SO angry at the powerful man who caused the damage.\n\nAnd that was just the beginning because in present time, you learn that those horrific moments Shay and her friends experienced was just the start of something even worse and cult-like. Learning about it and getting into its depths was both fascinating because of the philosophy behind the whys, yet so disturbing.\n\nI also really enjoyed the complexity and development of characters, particularly Shay and Laurel. They're not black and white at all and have so much grey with their behaviors, actions, morals. But it was written in a way that even when they did questionable things, it made you think beyond just normal rationale.\n\nThe book included a couple of twists too that I didn\u2019t quite see coming, but also wasn\u2019t totally surprised about. Overall, I thought it was well done because it brought out several feelings while reading and made wonder how messed up our society could be and if things like this truly exist. Read if you want a disturbing psychological thriller!\n\nRating: 4.5/5\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f: misogyny, rape, sexual assault, abuse, suicide", "total_engagement": 15, "engagement_rate": 0.0011578541103820917, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-01T21:29:56.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "man", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "beginning", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "read", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "college", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thriller", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "shay", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "jamie", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "laurel", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ashley winstead", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reviews", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039595948, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.117Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.117Z"}, {"id": 607775132039595947, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "372225300", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.115Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.115Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695562, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:44.462Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:41.462Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695563, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:44.466Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:41.476Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175092849246, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CluIa9DS_LR/", "post_id": "2985360639625261777", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/6916eb0738a323aa6caf41d570c26d4f.JPEG", "phash": "f559886257969ae8", "image_entities": [{"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8245097398757935}, {"entity": "chandelier", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4725618064403534}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.407947301864624}, {"entity": "canned packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2681525945663452}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20169579982757568}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T00:13:23.362Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-27T22:37:13.565Z"}}], "post_text": "ONCE UPON A DECEMBER - Book review!\n\nThis was my first holiday book of the season and it definitely got me in the festive mood and had me craving all things cozy and holiday-y!\n\nI\u2019ve adored the Amy Reichert books I\u2019ve read in the past, so was expecting this one to be heartwarming and sweet, but also filled with her signature foodie aspects. And that was pretty much exactly what this book was\u2026 but also with magic!\n\nSure, this book might\u2019ve been a tad cheesy in some ways\u2014 Astra Noel Snow and Jack Clausen are our two MCs\u2014 and had all the elements of your typical rom com. But it was still fun!\n\nJack works in his family\u2019s Kringle bakery in the Julemarked\u2014 a magical location that moves to various Christmas Markets around the world and where time is different and they only have Decembers. Over the last fifteen years, the Julemarked has made several appearances in Milwaukee where Astra and her three best friends visit as a yearly tradition. Though Jack and Astra have had multiple interactions over that time, Jack is the only one who\u2019s remembered them, but this year he is determined to make Astra remember too so he can finally make a move.\n\nThough it was a bit confusing to understand at first, I thought the premise of the magical Julemarked was so unique! Plus you know me and my love for books that messes with time!\n\nOther things I enjoyed were the female friendships, Bernie the dog and the shenanigans she got into, and the holiday vibes. From the market itself to the hot chocolate and Kringle, I wanted it all.\n\nI will also say that in some ways, the romance didn\u2019t quite work for me. There were moments between Astra and Jack that were cute, but I think the whole time thing made it seem a little insta-lovey to me and like there might\u2019ve been a weird age gap at one point? Jack also came off a bit selfish at times, though at the end he may have redeemed himself. Lastly, there was a trope included towards the end that I wasn\u2019t a big fan of.\n\nRegardless, this was still a fun and unique read to get into the holiday spirit and it was one that made you think about what you might do in Astra\u2019s situation!\n\nRating: 3/5\n\nThanks @berkleyromance for the gifted copy!", "total_engagement": 4, "engagement_rate": 0.00030876109610189115,

Trying to keep this as broad and spoiler free as I can for those who haven\u2019t read the whole series yet!\n\nFinlay (and Vero) are back at it again with some of their crazy antics in this third installment of the Finlay Donovan series!\n\nSo far they\u2019ve gotten themselves mixed up in murders, police investigations, Russian mafias, near death experiences, and more, but it\u2019s still not over. This book, there are essentially two plot lines: 1) trying to figure out the identity of EasyClean, a hit person from the dark web and 2) paying off debts.\n\nThe setting was fun because it primarily takes place at a police academy/ bootcamp except it\u2019s one for the community to partake in to get a taste of what the police life is like! And yes... our very own Finlay and Vero find themselves stuck here and are simultaneously trying to get the answers to their own questions while also making sure to steer clear of any potential killers.\n\nIt felt a bit like a locked room mystery because you\u2019re presented with a cast of characters and just know that one of them is up to something shady, but you don\u2019t know who or why. So I did enjoy that! However, where things got a murky for me was just the crossover of the two aforementioned plots. There were a few times where I got a bit confused trying to keep track of what info was relevant to what. Or even trying to understand how it all tied together.\n\nAlso, maybe it was the mood I was in while reading, but for some reason Vero\u2019s character just seemed like a LOT. It was the same person from the previous books, but almost\u2026 amped up way more to where her actions just seemed too much for me at times. But again, could just be me being picky!\n\nRegardless though, this book still has the same humor, laughable moments, and one liners that I enjoyed so much in the first two. Plus, we do get to see so much more of Detective Nick Anthony and that\u2019s always a positive!\n\nAs you would expect too, this books leaves off with yet another cliffhanger so you can bet there will be more to come and I can\u2019t wait to see how that pans out!\n\nRating: 3.75/5\n\nThank you @minotaurbooks for the gifted copy!

Very mixed feelings.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the positives! First, everyone did enjoy the concept of the story and found the initial premise to be intriguing. The world and story building was also easy enough to follow along and the story did read quickly and for the most part, kept everyone engaged as there were several of us who finished in 24 hours. There was an element of mystery in trying to figure out what Fable\u2019s endgame is and how it ties in with Saint. Plus, out of all the characters, Saint by far seemed to be the most fleshed out and compelling and everybody was very interested in his story and background!\n\nNow we get into some of the things that didn\u2019t work\u2026\n\nAs aforementioned, the idea of the story was great, however we collectively felt that the execution wasn\u2019t quite there. While there was the overarching plot of Fable trying to reclaim her status, everything that happened in between felt a little bit like a whole lot of nothing. It was just one event after another, but it almost felt more like a checklist where once task was complete, it was forgotten and you\u2019d move onto the next. Because of this, all the situations never felt suspenseful and it didn\u2019t really feel like they connected to tell a greater story.\n\nThe characters themselves seemed like they could\u2019ve been developed a bit more because we had a hard time envisioning them. And the romance is something the group is split on because some enjoyed it while others felt it came on so suddenly and in a bit of an odd fashion. (Feel free to take a stab at where I fall on this)\n\nTo sum it up, I would say that this was underwhelming, particularly for those of us who had heard such amazing things heading in. HOWEVER, I will say that this first book did leave a lot of questions unanswered and ended on a cliffhanger so despite the mixed thoughts, most of us are very curious about the second book! But also still mostly excited for SAINT which just released!\n\nGroup rating: 3/5", "total_engagement": 9, "engagement_rate": 0.0006947124662292551, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-09T21:28:37.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "everyone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book club", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "saint", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "author", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "event", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "go", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "characters", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rounds", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "everything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "results", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bookstagram", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fable", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "share", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039596120, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.495Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.495Z"}, {"id": 607775132039596119, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1921099901", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.493Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.493Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695593, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:44.551Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:41.612Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695594, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:44.555Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:41.617Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175094579985, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CmFR4NKAPR8/", "post_id": "2991876156665427068", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://instagram.fagc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/318926870_178936408098090_2244448460887390605_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080_sh0.08&_nc_ht=instagram.fagc1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=oSAsc8QjYbAAX8Y4dA1&edm=APU89FABAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBOOPeBth-zw2G1vgxXpHBfTNafj3neYN2A_R2erf8AQg&oe=63B362BE&_nc_sid=86f79a", "phash": null, "image_entities": null, "phash_property": null}], "post_text": "\u2018Tis the season for\u2026 Blind Date With A Book: Gifted White Elephant Style!\n\nThis was second year of putting together a this Blind Date With A Book gifting for friends and it was another success!\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a fun and bookish gift idea for a group whether it be a book club, friends, or family\u2014 try this!\n\nI had a blast picking books of different genres and diversity (always nice to have variety and branch out!) to gift & then even more fun wrapping them it and writing out the clues.\n\nWhen the time came to \u201cgift\u201d it was done white elephant style where people would go around choosing and stealing books purely based off the clues!\n\nPretty simple and for a book loving gift giver like myself, it was the perfect combination this holiday season!

Ellingham also isn\u2019t your ordinary school because it\u2019s students have unique studies, such as our MC Stevie who loves true crime and has her mind set on trying to solve the infamous Ellingham kidnapping/ murders from the 1930s. But as she continues to make discoveries, she realizes there\u2019s more going on that what it seems\u2026\n\nThe first book establishes a lot of the setting and characters. We meet Stevie\u2019s classmates and friends, learn the basics of the case, and find trouble in the present. The story read quickly and was engaging because as Stevie begins to uncover some truths, we also make discoveries from the past narrative that created intriguing twists. Aside from that, there\u2019s also the start of the storyline about a very unlikeable politician named Edward King and he seemingly has more ties to Ellingham than first imagined.\n\nThe second in the series was just as interesting as things at the school escalate even more and there definitely seems to be a killer on the grounds. Plus we get more of the Edward King saga, which I honestly wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of since it didn\u2019t seem to be super relevant to the greater mystery. However, that mystery of who was behind the decades old crime is finally revealed, but yet more questions seem to remain unanswered which leads perfectly into the third.\n\nIn the final book, there are even more twists and Stevie (with the help of her friends) race against a winter storm to finally put all the pieces together and the person behind the present day happenings is revealed in Hercule Poirot style and its also explained how everything has tied together. There\u2019s again more King drama too, but I still didn\u2019t care about that part very much.\n\nOverall, I thought it was a quick and fun series! There\u2019s a lot of whodunnit type of vibes and homages to Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes. I may not have loved it quite as much as some other similar series, but would still recommend if you like YA/ true crime/ mystery type of books!\n\nSeries rating: 4/5", "total_engagement": 16,

one!\n\nI\u2019ve seen such incredible reviews about this independently published book so I will say that I did have fairly high expectations. And while I did enjoy, I wouldn\u2019t say I loved it and that its one of the best romances I\u2019ve read. So, lets get into it.\n\nI of coursed adored the setting\u2014 the small town, everybody knows everybody and their business, type of vibes + the actual Christmas tree farm of Lovelight Farms itself! Everything about that was so cozy and really just encapsulated the spirit of the holidays.\n\nSome other things I enjoyed was the whole best friends to lovers and fake dating trope as those are two of my favorites in a romance. The relationship and banter between Stella and Luka was fun and sweet to read about it and aside from those two I also adored the other two members of the tree farm family! (Can\u2019t wait for their stories next!)\n\nDespite all the fun moments, there was also the plot line of saving Lovelight Farms by inviting an influencer, Evelyn, to visit and help promote it. I really liked the idea of this, however was a bit disappointed that we didn\u2019t actually see much of this at all. Instead, the bulk of the story was just leading up to Evelyn\u2019s arrival, but not TOO much happened once she was there and the visit didn\u2019t seem like a focal point of the story like the synopsis made it sound like it would be.\n\nThe other reason this slightly missed the mark for me was because of the way Stella and Luka went from friends to lovers. It just sort of\u2026 happened without a whole lot of tension and angst. Plus, the way Stella seemed to deny Luka of his feelings and how blind she was to it, got a little frustrating. Lastly, I did also feel like the writing was a bit repetitive at times\u2014 I wanted to count how many times all the characters hummed under their breath\u2026\n\nOverall though, this was still a cute and fun holiday read that really did feel like a Hallmark movie. Perhaps my exceptions were really high on this, but I did still enjoy enough and can see why its talked about so much!\n\nRating: 3.5/5", "total_engagement": 8, "engagement_rate": 0.0006175221922037823, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-16T22:42:15.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "members", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "expectations", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reviews", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "feed", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lovers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "everything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "luka", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "stella", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "evelyn", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "friends", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039596263, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.825Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.825Z"}, {"id": 607775132039596261, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "213112646", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.823Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.823Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695620, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:44.637Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:41.740Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695621, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:44.640Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:41.745Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175103712094, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CmXgeIRSqV7/", "post_id": "2997006884991051131", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/0930f8876ba22e2c74f3cad0b172e926.JPEG", "phash": "9cf339d7cea81130", "image_entities": [{"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9976838827133179}, {"entity": "bookcase", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9974272847175598}, {"entity": "furniture", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9813961386680603}, {"entity": "library", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9690845608711243}, {"entity": "publication", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9599562287330627}, {"entity": "retail", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9399044513702393}, {"entity": "bookselling", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9203406572341919}, {"entity": "shelf", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5819225311279297}, {"entity": "shelving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.439848393201828}, {"entity": "convenience store", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3160562515258789}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8628706932067871}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21097029745578766}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-05T23:37:57.124Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T08:54:20.966Z"}}], "post_text": "OONA OUT OF ORDER - Book Review!\n\nI have seen such positive reviews for this book ever since its release a couple of years back, especially about how it is such a great book to read while in your 20s/30... and I get why!\n\nThe premise was so fun and unique! Midnight is approaching and not only will it be a new year, but Oona will turn 19 and embark on her grand plans to travel to Europe with her boyfriend and band. However, things don\u2019t go as planned because at the stroke of midnight, Oona finds herself disoriented and wakes up as a 51 year old (though she still has the mind and memories of being 19). Eventually Oona learns that every year on her birthday, she\u2019ll leap to a different year of her life, meaning she\u2019ll experience her life\u2026out of order.\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed my reviews long enough, you might know that I love books that talk about time travel and the intricacies of it and how it can affect things. This story was no different! While it took a leap or two for me to grasp the concept of what was happening to Oona and trying to keep track of the current, past, and future whereabouts of her, it was still so interesting to watch her experience the events of her life at different times and ages.\n\nThis story included so many fun elements like nostalgia (particularly with music) and humor to more thought provoking ones, particularly about your approach to life and how your experiences throughout the years can change your perspective on things and even make you realize you shouldn\u2019t take things for granted. Throughout her journey, Oona definitely had both high and low points + moments  where she wanted to change her future only to realize you can\u2019t control everything and sometimes things happen, you just have to figure out a way to get by.\n\nI also really liked the relationship depicted between Oona and her mother, Madeline. Her mom was one of the few people privy to Oona\u2019s annual time jumps and while it was not easy for her to manage and there were rough times, there was definitely a lot of love and support between the two.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this and would definitely recommend if you\u2019re looking for a fun but stimulating contemporary read!\n\nRating: 4.5/5", "total_engagement": 8, "engagement_rate": 0.0006175221922037823, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-19T23:04:43.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reviews", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "madeline", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "books", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "oona", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "release", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "oona", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039596300, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.921Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.921Z"}, {"id": 607775132039596299, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-323476641", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.920Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:32.920Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695626, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:44.657Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:41.768Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695627, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:44.661Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:41.775Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175103712085, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CmcfrPKy45Y/", "post_id": "2998410762588491352", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/630698e66dd725c9873af8b89c06f656.JPEG", "phash": "f80c86f098dece1e", "image_entities": [{"entity": "christmas decoration", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9898249506950378}, {"entity": "christmas eve", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.979649543762207}, {"entity": "christmas ornament", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9670713543891907}, {"entity": "christmas tree", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9595150351524353}, {"entity": "christmas", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9588689804077148}, {"entity": "colorado spruce", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9369570016860962}, {"entity": "holiday ornament", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7868181467056274}, {"entity": "oregon pine", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5381263494491577}, {"entity": "tree", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21112452447414398}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8434179425239563}, {"entity": "chandelier", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2555203437805176}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24072207510471344}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T00:56:36.468Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T08:53:45.883Z"}}], "post_text": "KISS HER ONCE FOR ME - Book review!\n\nAnother quick holiday read for the season!

But of course, this agreement leads her to meeting the Kim-Prescott family which includes his sister, Jack\u2026\n\nI love me a fun fake dating trope, except this one totally had a bit of a twist because it wasn\u2019t just a love triangle between Andrew and Jack, but there was actually a love trapezoid with a fourth character, Dylan, an old friend of the siblings. The four + other Kim-Prescott family members are spending the Christmas holiday at their cabin and so much happens!\n\nFirst, there was a lot of tension and build up between Ellie and Jack. Sure they tip toe around each other, but eventually they begin communicating about what happened last year and things begin to escalate (and get steamy!) between the two. But of course there\u2019s complications since Jack cannot know about the fake engagement, so Ellie finds herself torn between what to do.\n\nThis book also had so many cozy holiday moments! From cookie baking, to caroling, to getting caught in snow storms, it made me just want to curl up with a warm blanket. I also enjoyed the themes of familial expectations and how different people handle the weight and failure and having some pretty terrible parents. But yet, still showing that family is important and how much love there is between them.\n\nThough this book was a tad insta-lovey and did have a few too many pop song/ artist references for me (I like them, but it felt like every other page in this book), I still did enjoy it overall and it was great for the holidays!\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThanks @atriabooks for my gifted copy!",

However, after seeing many rave reviews for it, I decided to give it a shot and was so happy I did because it was so different than her past work and so good!\n\nThe story follows Harriet (Harry) and her recent engagement to Edward Holbeck\u2014 the next in line to take over the Holbeck family\u2019s fortune. The Holbecks are massively wealthy and privileged with their fair share of secrets. They also love their games, particularly mind games and ones that are pretty extravagant. Soon, Harry meets the family and one of its members gives her a tape to listen to and on it, Harry discovers it\u2019s a confession to past crimes. Thus, begins the ultimate game between Harry and the Holbeck family\u2026\n\nThe beginning felt a little on the slower side, but I think its because it helped introduce us to all the characters and establish the background to Harry, Edward, and the Holbeck\u2019s in their entirety. However, once Harry actually got to listening to the tape and some of the games ensued (no thank you to Krampusnacht!), the pace really picked up and became more addicting!\n\nPlus, the ending and last third or so was super explosive and intense! Another game is underway and I felt myself on edge just waiting for the dominoes to fall and everything to come together. And it did in wild fashion with a twist I didn\u2019t quite see coming!\n\nI will also say that there are definitely some scenes in this book that are on the darker side and not for the faint of heart as there are a couple of brief scenes that are a bit more graphic in detail. However, I think it did add to the overarching story and just haunting atmosphere of what was going on.\n\nLastly, the book did bring up some interesting conversations regarding power, family and just made you question the lengths one may go to protect their loved ones as well as themselves.\n\nOverall, I was very happy with this one and would recommend if you\u2019re looking for a quick and bingeworthy thriller! It was also perfect for winter because the events take place in the weeks leading up to Christmas!\n\nRating: 4/5", "total_engagement": 12, "engagement_rate": 0.0009262832883056735, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-28T23:38:54.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "game", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "shot", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "beginning", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "holbecks", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "author", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "games", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "harry", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "family", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "family", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "little", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reviews", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "experiences", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "work", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9265488982200623}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039596467, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:33.319Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:33.319Z"}, {"id": 607775132039596466, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "182201354", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:33.318Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:33.318Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695655, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:44.740Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:41.885Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695657, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:44.744Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:41.891Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175115290913, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cmz4QOTPxA4/", "post_id": "3004992781857787960", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/3372d94386f304c5566129e6b5179c30.JPEG", "phash": "e18484ce9af1697b", "image_entities": [{"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9951130747795105}, {"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9703590869903564}, {"entity": "coffee", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.841621994972229}, {"entity": "caffeine", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3886394202709198}, {"entity": "white coffee", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.27392858266830444}, {"entity": "cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.26218944787979126}, {"entity": "pottery", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2203778773546219}, {"entity": "saucer", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20662111043930054}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8503547310829163}, {"entity": "computer monitor", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8393286466598511}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3739406168460846}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.343503475189209}, {"entity": "clock tower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2794313132762909}, {"entity": "picture frame", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2063807249069214}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T00:11:09.343Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T08:55:48.857Z"}}], "post_text": "ALL THE DANGEROUS THINGS - Book review!\n\nThe author\u2019s debut novel, A FLICKER IN THE DARK, was one of my favorite thrillers this last year so it's safe to say I was pretty hyped to read this and couldn\u2019t wait to see what she did in her second!\n\nI admittedly went in blind and am actually happy that I did! This book picks up one year after the disappearance and kidnapping of Isabelle\u2019s son, Mason. Over the last year, the case has gone cold and Isabelle has become an insomniac as she hangs onto the belief and hope that Mason is still out there and that more work needs to be done to find him.\n\nFirst, I loved the implementation of all the discussions around sleep, particularly the comparisons and contrast brought up between a sleepwalker and an insomniac\u2014 both of which Isabelle has been guilty of. There are a few chapters intermixed within the main narrative that flashback to Isabelle\u2019s childhood where she was known as a sleepwalker. During her youth, there were quite a few incidents that took place in her household and as an adult, she\u2019s still working on piecing together what exactly those things were.\n\nHowever in present day, Isabelle is on a mission to find any clues that lead to what happened the night Mason was taken from his crib. This leads her to a true crime podcaster, Waylon, and she hopes to be able to tell her story and bring more attention to the case. As things begin to surface and Isabelle begins to grasp at the truths of what happened to her as a child, an image begins to form and you\u2019re led to question and wonder who exactly is the dangerous person here.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s also something going on with Isabelle\u2019s ex-husband/ Mason\u2019s father that seems a little suspect and at least adds another layer of complication to everything.\n\nThough the pace at the beginning was a bit on the slower side, I did find this book to super addicting and very psychological! It made you question things and there were even a couple of twists that kept the ending exciting! Overall, would recommend if you\u2019re looking for a solid thriller!\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nI did read an early digital copy of this thanks to @minotaurbooks !

Sign me up!\n\nI adored the overarching concept of this story\u2014 matchmaking vs. online dating, but where they both use the Chinese Zodiac to help match and find compatibility. Olivia has recently taken over her grandmother\u2019s matchmaking business, Lunar Love. But in the age of online dating, she finds herself in competition with ZodiaCupid and more specifically, its handsome yet infuriating founder, Bennett.\n\nFrom the first page, I knew I was going to enjoy this book! The writing was fun, there were mentions of baos and other delicious foods, a meet cute, and so much more. I also really appreciated how both Olivia and Bennett were mixed race and there were lots of discussions on identity as they both strived to truly understand their Chinese heritage, Bennett in particular. Plus being Chinese American myself, there were still so many other things I felt like I could relate to which I always love when reading.\n\nAs for the love story itself, there is definitely an enemies to lovers mindset along with the whole work rivalry piece. Combine it all and it made for some entertainment as well as funny moments between our two characters! Aside from that though, there was also a lot of talk about keeping with tradition vs. change as well as how important compatibility truly is in a relationship. While Olivia and Bennett have differing opinions, it did make for some interesting discussion!\n\nLastly, I just adored Bennett and found him to be such a wholesome love interest! Though admittedly there were moments (the third act conflict) where I felt like Olivia was a biiiit too rash to jump to assumptions about him and I wanted to protect him at all costs!\n\nSometimes I feel like I hit a rom com wall where everything feels repetitive and, but this debut absolutely exceeded any expectations I had and felt fresh! Plus it\u2019s the perfect read to pick up with the Lunar New Year and the Year of the Rabbit just around the corner!\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThanks so much @readforeverpub for the gifted ARC\u2014 releases 1/10/23 or snag now through BOTM!", "total_engagement": 24, "engagement_rate": 0.001852566576611347, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-04T22:35:06.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "bennett", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "concept", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "culture", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "olivia", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "matchmaking", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lots", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "debut", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "chinese", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "readforeverpub"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039596568, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:33.619Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:33.619Z"}, {"id": 607775132039596567, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "2136212435", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:33.618Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:33.618Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695675, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:44.812Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:41.977Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695676, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:44.817Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:41.982Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175125219465, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CnFvJGTSA3t/", "post_id": "3010019259394297325", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/140bdc494aeba23e900650a9e70be7b3.JPEG", "phash": "b023577e6ad8e590", "image_entities": [{"entity": "brochure", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7163490056991577}, {"entity": "paper", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.44551536440849304}, {"entity": "diary", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.33021456003189087}, {"entity": "mail", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2967114746570587}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21153128147125244}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.785351037979126}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5815162062644958}, {"entity": "throw pillow", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.47323012351989746}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T00:15:33.121Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T08:57:41.007Z"}}], "post_text": "THE VILLA - Book review!\n\n\u201cInspired by Fleetwood Mac, the Manson murders, and the infamous summer Percy and Mary Shelley spent with Lord Byron at a Lake Geneva castle\u2013\u2013the birthplace of\u00a0Frankenstein\u2013\u2013The Villa\u00a0welcomes you into its deadly legacy.\u201d\n\nThat blurb really sums up the vibes and atmosphere! The book has two timelines: 1) In the present, childhood friends and now authors, Emily and Chess, travel to Villa Aestas in Italy for some bonding and to work on their respective writing. 2) In 1974 a young woman and aspiring author, Mari, is staying at the same Villa with her boyfriend, stepsister, and two other up and coming musicians. In 1974, Pierce was murdered at the Villa which has led to questions about what actually happened. It isn\u2019t until Emily does some digging that she begins to reveal much more and realizes things in the past seem to parallel the present.\n\nThis read quickly with alternating POVs, timelines, and even had formats like emails, news clippings, song lyrics, etc. I definitely found myself invested in the mystery of the 1974 murder and enjoyed Mari\u2019s parts in learning about what occurred in that Villa like lots of drugs, alcohol, and sex. It was surprising to read about some of the antics, but it helped add tension to the story.\n\nThere\u2019s also many toxic relationships in both narratives, but I liked how the author drew parallels between the two, particularly when it came to Emily and Mari. There even seemed to be a theme of women who regain power and find the strength to get out of unhealthy situations which I found interesting.\n\nNow, the ending gave me some mixed feelings. A secret was revealed when it came to Emily and Chess\u2019s friendship and I didn\u2019t expect it to go that way or the resulting actions of it, thought I guess it made sense. And then there was also the twist in Mari\u2019s story. That one I\u2019m still really thinking on it\u2014 did I like it, did I not? But the ambiguity might be what made the conclusion so thought provoking!\n\nOverall, it was a fast read and I think it\u2019s my favorite by this author!\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThank you @stmartinspress

YOU in the spring, I've been waiting for Tara\u2019s story. I mean... she\u2019s a book influencer!! Like what a fun and relatable nod to this space! But aside from that little tidbit, I was excited because I loved getting glimpses of Tara previously and genuinely just enjoyed this author\u2019s writing.\n\nAs mentioned, this story follows Tara\u2014 a NICU nurse/ book influencer who has had her heart broken by guys over the years, but is still on the hunt for her happily ever after. Enter Trevor. Tatted member of the Boston Fire Department and Tara\u2019s new roommate who has some baggage of his won. The result? Forced proximity romance with lots of tension, laughable scenes, and sweet moments!\n\nSome things I really enjoyed was all the fun book/ trope references. If you didn\u2019t know, prior to becoming a published author, Amy Lea was a bookstagrammer herself! So seeing those behind the scenes of Tara and diving into the bookish world through from another perspective was a blast!\n\nI also liked how this book didn\u2019t shy away from some deeper topics. For example, part of the premise is that Tara goes back to reconnect with her exes, hoping that one could be her second chance. Along the way it\u2019s revealed that some of her exes saw her as \u201ccrazy\u201d. Tara and the author vehemently argue against the use of this word to break that stigma of \u201ccrazy\u201d women and I loved that so much! There were also other meaningful topics, particularly when it came to Trevor\u2019s background too.\n\nAs for Trevor, he did take a bit to grow on me because he is a more complex love interest than what appears on the surface. (Plus it\u2019s really hard to live up to Scott!) Even though I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of how he handled the third act breakup, he still has his fair share of redeeming qualities (even with the Crocs!) and was the perfect complement to Tara.\n\nOverall, I had fun reading this! The events of the story also lead up to a Valentine\u2019s Day Gala, so its a great read with February fast approaching!

I\u2019d seen this book around quite a bit over the last few months, so it felt right that my library hold came in just in time so I could read this in the new year.\n\nThis book was a bit of a blend of different genres like mystery to romance to fairytale to magical realism. I really enjoyed the writing, particularly in regards to the descriptions of everything because it was so atmospheric and really made me feel like I was on the island of Saiorse with our characters.\n\nYears ago, Emery\u2019s best friend, Lily, was murdered and the person accused of it was the love of Emery\u2019s life, August. Though August was found innocent of the crime, the community still thought differently, and August ending up leaving the island\u2026only to return again now. And his presences has begun to resurface old wounds and grievances and has Emery trying to reconcile with what actually happened.\n\nThe mystery aspect was my favorite part of the book. I was super interested in trying to get to the bottom of what happened to Lily and the roles (if any) that both Emery and August played in it. It was very much a slow burn to get to the truth, but in some ways I did appreciate the build up and how suspicion was created amongst the characters before getting to that final reveal.\n\nOne of the things I did struggle with though was the romance between Emery and August. There were moments where they both came off a bit immature for their age and even though this was written as an adult fiction, it felt YA-like. Sure, there were scenes that were on the sweeter side and they were easier to connect with, but overall I had a difficult time with it.\n\nI also did expect there to be more magical elements to the story, so was disappointed there wasn\u2019t. I did enjoy the very little hints of magic that did appear in the story, just wished there was more of that.\n\nLastly, the ending wrapped up very nicely, but I also thought it was underwhelming and maybe the chaos lover inside me, wanted more drama!\n\nIn the end, I think my high expectations let me down a tad, but I did still enjoy and can see why others really love it!\n\nRating: 3/5",

am sharing a book review of a holiday-ish read in January\u2026 this was my book club\u2019s December pick and we got a bit behind on meeting, but better late than never!\n\nThis was everyone\u2019s first official Agatha Christie read and the Queen of Crime delivered leaving us all wanting to dive into more of her extensive catalog!\n\nThe story is essentially about the wealthy Lee family (and a few outsiders) who come together during Christmas at the request of the head of the family, Simeon Lee. There\u2019s always been some tension amongst the four Lee brothers and they soon find out their father wants to change his will. Very shortly after, Simeon winds up dead and the infamous Hercule Poirot arrives on scene to find out who committed the murder. \n\nThe first part of the book sets the scene and introduces us to all the key people and their backgrounds. Though a bit slower, it was still well done and we liked in particular how Christie wrote each of the brothers to have their own distinct voice and personalities so it was fairly easy to tell them apart.\n\nAs for the mystery itself, it was very engaging and everyone did enjoy how it was all structured. It was engaging to the point where you had your own detective hat on and were trying to piece it all together in wondering who did it and why. Even if there were scenes that seemed less \u201cimportant\u201d, we soon realized that everything does have a purpose and there was probably still some minor clue hidden somewhere not so obvious.\n\nIn the end, the final reveal (done in true Hercule Poirot fashion) was shocking to some while others had a bit of an inkling. Regardless, the events that led to the order and the manner in which it was executed was so intricate and clever! It made us all think back on the details interspersed throughout the story and suddenly its like everything clicked!\n\nOverall, everyone enjoyed this and many drew comparisons to the movie, Knives Out, though of course people now know where the inspiration came from!\n\nEveryone rated it 4/5, so I\u2019d say it was a very solid read!\n\nIf you haven\u2019t read this yet, I suggest adding it to your holiday TBR for next season!", "total_engagement": 9, "engagement_rate": 0.0006947124662292551, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-15T21:12:21.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands":

Stories\nthat provide knowledge, understanding, and appreciation for those who fought, perished, survived, and lived through WWII.\n\nThis follows Lyudmila \u201cMila\u201d Pavlichenko\u2014 a female Russian sniper\u2014 as she fights on the frontlines of the Red Army and becomes known as Lady Death because of her (official) 309 kill count. You learn about Mila\u2019s background and the reasons why and how she ended up in the middle of the war and defending her country.\n\nThere\u2019s so much meaningful discussion of identity as Mila tends to compartmentalize her former historian/ mother self with the sniper the war has turned her into. I also appreciated the conversations on death and how Mila approaches it because she breaks that sniper stigma of being a cold blooded killer with no emotion.\n\nAside from Mila, there was other characters like Lena, Kostia, and Lyonya that acted as great counterparts. On the flip side there was also Alexei, Mila\u2019s husband (only legally) and he was the WORST. But he made the perfect enemy and also helped showcase the sexism and how woman were treated then.\n\nYes, this story is heartbreaking. There were a few chapters where I had to put the book down because it was so sad. But it didn\u2019t shy from the horrors of war and instead showed the struggles and resiliency.\n\nI did find the second half of the book during Mila\u2019s propaganda tour in America, to be slower. Another plot does develop and it all came crashing down in climatic fashion at the end. It was clever, though did seem a bit out there for compared to the rest of the story, but I later learned this aspect was created by the author to fill in gaps of Mila's history.\n\nLastly the blurb in the author\u2019s note was so fun: It mentions how WWII was won with Soviet Blood, British Intelligence, and American Steel. Quinn\u2019s previous novel, THE ROSE CODE, depicted British Intelligence. Now THE DIAMOND EYE is about Soviet Blood.

Andie is determined to make the absolute most out of her time at college, but as you might expect, things don\u2019t exactly go as expected. First, there\u2019s her boyfriend she surprised with her transfer only to realize their relationship might be more complicated than she imagined. Then there\u2019s her RA Milo, her new friends, and then there\u2019s the well known and legendary campus radio show which she somehow founds herself right in the midst of! Throw that all together, and you get a crazy ride.\n\nI thought this book was just so much fun and did a great job of depicting a young woman going through her freshman year of college and the highs and lows of it. It shows the struggles Andie has trying to fit in and find her footing at school while also finding the balance of schoolwork and social life. Plus, I really enjoyed the radio show aspect and the importance of it to the story.\n\nI also really enjoyed the characters themselves and the group of friends. Her roommate Shay in particular will probably be relatable to a lot because she\u2019s an avid book reader who runs a bookstagram, but also kind doesn\u2019t have life figured out which I think can speak to a lot of us! Milo too with his caffeine addiction was a fun and slightly complex character because he\u2019s that guy that seems to have so many different layers to him, but really is just super supportive in caring in his own way. And the tension between him and Andie throughout the entirety of the story was so palpable!\n\nAside from that, there were other great themes especially when it came to family. AND in true Emma Lord fashion, there were a few different occasions where this book brought up some delectable sounding eats (particularly the bagels!) that will have you craving something sweet!\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThanks @wednesdaybooks for the gifted copy, out now!", "total_engagement": 3, "engagement_rate": 0.00023157082207641837, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-31T22:35:06.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "coming of age", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "campus", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "romance", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "blue ridge state", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "shay", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "milo", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "alma", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "andie", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "wednesdaybooks"}], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9643125534057617}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039597068, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:34.745Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:34.745Z"}, {"id": 607775132039597066, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1535891763", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:34.744Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:34.744Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695741, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.073Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.355Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695744, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.078Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.365Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175151781922, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CoIyEM5A7RN/", "post_id": "3028890940451566669", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/eb540141dfbbde5a9fb42c28c574a715.JPEG", "phash": "aac9c725d93205e7", "image_entities": [{"entity": "christmas decoration", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9976511597633362}, {"entity": "furniture", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9950633645057678}, {"entity": "home", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9589821100234985}, {"entity": "interior design", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9344281554222107}, {"entity": "living room", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8731250166893005}, {"entity": "orange", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8395830988883972}, {"entity": "red", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7881262898445129}, {"entity": "room", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6981666684150696}, {"entity": "table", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2728850543498993}, {"entity": "lip gloss", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2727997899055481}, {"entity": "yellow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.26358625292778015}, {"entity": "wallet", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20234414935112}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6326935887336731}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5507131814956665}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5045450329780579}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.47289180755615234}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3070414960384369}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21074923872947693}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-05T23:46:48.180Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:02:07.815Z"}}], "post_text": "Happy first day of February!

What are you planning to read this month?\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#bookstoread #toberead #tbrlist #bookreels #bookishreels #whattoread #februaryreads #bookishreel #bookreelsofinstagram #currentreads #somanybookssolittletime #advancedreaderscopy #nightcrawling #anatomyalovestory #thefourwinds #diversifyyourbookshelf #diversereads #whattoreadnext #whatareyoureading #readwhatyouown #upcomingbook #anticipatedreads #fortheloveofreading #bookobsession #readingismyhappyplace #bookreel", "total_engagement": 20, "engagement_rate": 0.0015438054805094559, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-01T22:56:35.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "book club", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reading", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "books", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mood reader", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "advancedreaderscopy"}, {"name": "anatomyalovestory"}, {"name": "anticipatedreads"}, {"name": "bookishreel"}, {"name": "bookishreels"}, {"name": "bookobsession"}, {"name": "bookreel"}, {"name": "bookreels"}, {"name": "bookreelsofinstagram"}, {"name": "bookstoread"}, {"name": "currentreads"}, {"name": "diversereads"}, {"name": "diversifyyourbookshelf"}, {"name": "februaryreads"}, {"name": "fortheloveofreading"}, {"name": "nightcrawling"}, {"name": "readingismyhappyplace"}, {"name": "readwhatyouown"}, {"name": "somanybookssolittletime"}, {"name": "tbrlist"}, {"name": "thefourwinds"}, {"name": "toberead"}, {"name": "upcomingbook"}, {"name": "whatareyoureading"}, {"name": "whattoread"}, {"name": "whattoreadnext"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9822316765785217}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039597135, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:34.891Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:34.891Z"}, {"id": 607775132039597130, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1584119868", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:34.889Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:34.889Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695748, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.094Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.392Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695751, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.099Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.399Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175151781915, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CoN93YWvuFe/", "post_id": "3030350210850021726", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/ad37e715aa86c868ca171343e01d0ef3.JPEG", "phash": "96d5e289d72dc116", "image_entities": [{"entity": "leaf", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4294697642326355}, {"entity": "herbal", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2568965256214142}, {"entity": "plant", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23242098093032837}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.93839430809021}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5753201842308044}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.40874427556991577}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T00:59:27.438Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:01:58.136Z"}}], "post_text": "MAAME - Book review!\n\n\u201cMaame (ma-meh) has many meanings in Twi but in my case, it means woman.\u201d\n\nWhat an incredible debut by Jessica George! I can see thing being one of those \u201cmust reads while in your 20s/30s\u201d, but honestly I think it\u2019s just a must read.\n\nWe follow Maddie\u2014 a 25 year old English born Ghanian\u2014 and her journey to finding her own way, identity, and even claiming her name. For the last few years, Maddie has been the primary caretaker for her father who suffers from Parkinson\u2019s. Her brother never steps in to help, and her mother spends half her time in Ghana. Upon her mother\u2019s latest return, Maddie decides to finally move out and start her own life.\n\nI absolutely loved Maddie. She was just a lovable and relatable character trying to navigate the messiness of life. Maddie has taken on the responsibility of caring for her father while simultaneously clashing with the rest of her family because they don't understand the burden. It\u2019s so raw and you can see how this has affected her and there were many times I wanted to hug her (particularly when dealing with her overbearing mother). Her voice felt so real and I also loved that she (like myself) also Googles everything! \ud83d\ude02\n\nAside from that Maddie also experiences the trials and tribulations of all kinds of relationships including work, friends, romantic, sexual, etc. There\u2019s moments she\u2019s happy and feels like a whole new person and then others where she gets completely burned and has to learn how to handle these different situations.\n\nGrief and mental illness are two other topics that play a focal point in Maddie\u2019s story and I really appreciated how the author depicted these hardships in such an authentic and vulnerable way.\n\nLastly, it made me sad to see just how often Maddie was faced with micro aggressions and racism in her day to day life and in almost every setting. But again I think the author did this very well in incorporating these issues to create very insightful dialogue and conversation.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed and would recommend (its a BOTM choice!) because I can only hope others will fall in love with Maddie as much as I did!\n\nRating: 5/5\n\nThanks @stmartinspress for the gifted ARC!", "total_engagement": 17, "engagement_rate": 0.0013122346584330375, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-03T23:11:57.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "maddie", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "father", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "debut", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "case", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "stmartinspress"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039597252, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.153Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.153Z"}, {"id": 607775132039597249, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-138206835", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.151Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.151Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695754, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.122Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.437Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695755, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.126Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.443Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175151781906, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CoS99poA8f6/", "post_id": "3031758016593774586", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/d37277f37cba3908c65b6597ab5389ad.JPEG", "phash": "b28b0d4cd0c69cf7", "image_entities": [{"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.999906063079834}, {"entity": "bookcase", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9994520545005798}, {"entity": "furniture", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9991299510002136}, {"entity": "library", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9811522960662842}, {"entity": "novel", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8898268938064575}, {"entity": "publication", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8842666745185852}, {"entity": "shelf", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8419963717460632}, {"entity": "bookselling", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7545940279960632}, {"entity": "convenience food", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.33406731486320496}, {"entity": "convenience store", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24790143966674805}, {"entity": "shelving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24663405120372772}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.513176679611206}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.438717246055603}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.41737598180770874}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4053553342819214}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.33496394753456116}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3292892277240753}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2954903244972229}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.25849974155426025}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23371224105358124}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23101530969142914}, {"entity": "license plate", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2301539182662964}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21116191148757935}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21106158196926117}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T00:38:54.238Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:01:44.064Z"}}], "post_text": "I ran out of shelf space a long time ago and ever since, the books have slowly piled up into little stacks under, next to, and in front of my bookshelf.

review!\n\nWhat a compulsive and addicting debut! If you enjoy stories about con artists, anti-heroes, the rich and powerful, manipulation, extreme cat and mouse mind games\u2026 then you\u2019ll want to add this to your TBR!\n\nThis story follows Bea, a woman raised by her swindling mother who\u2019s looking to escape her dark past by marrying Collin Case and joining his uber wealthy family. Bea\u2019s ambition to claim what she wants and believes she deserves has her facing off against other members of the Case family as well as Collin\u2019s best friend, Gale, in the biggest cat and mouse game where the stakes are high.\n\nBea is an extremely complex character. She is absolutely flawed and damaged because of the horrible things she dealt with when younger and because of her toxic mother. Present day Bea is our narrator and she does not come off as particularly likable. Sure she\u2019s extremely confident in herself, but her words and actions also make her seem very vain, pretentious, and her ambition to manipulate anybody and situation to her desires. We do also get glimpses into her past and as the story progresses you see some cracks in her facade and really begin to understand what she\u2019s after and why. Admittedly, I tend to struggle with unlikeable characters, however Bea was very well developed and the very definition of an anti-hero that you hate to love.\n\nThe book also dives into the society of old money/ the wealthiest families. There\u2019s a theme of \u201cprotect your own\u201d and shunning outsiders into this world. It really showcased how different and how these groups really do operate in their own little rich world.\n\nAs for the battle of wits, it was interesting seeing Bea and Gale go head to head trying to outsmart each other.

During the show\u2019s six year run, Liv always had a close relationship with Ransom, the actor who played her character\u2019s love interest. That is until the end where things went awry between the two. Now, fourteen years later, the cast is getting back together for a one episode reunion special causing the past to collide with the present as Liv and Ransom are forced to reckon with their history as they also both begin to wonder what new strides they can reach in their careers.\n\nI\u2019m admittedly not and never have been the biggest tv show watcher or into the celebrity/ gossip scene, BUT I do still enjoy reading books about it like this one! It did make me think of things like Full House & it\u2019s fairly recent reboot, as well as the Friends reunion\u2014 and because of that it made me feel all types of nostalgia for those types of sitcoms (even if I only ever watched a handful!).\n\nThere was a best friends to lovers and a second chance romance in this love story and I genuinely did enjoy seeing how Liv and Ransom\u2019s journey played out and there was definitely some tension and sweet moments sprinkled throughout! Aside from the romance aspect, I also liked just seeing the different types of relationships the characters had with other members of the cast or even with their team. It did feel like getting an inside glimpse into the life of a celebrity! (Though I know there\u2019s still gotta be some suspension of belief!)\n\nI also loved how the inclusion of news articles/ tabloids, blog posts, and other forms of media to really make this feel like you were actually seeing celebrity drama unfold. Though this book made me despise paparazzi and gossip even more than I may already have\u2014 it just goes to show how its so hard to escape that sort of stuff when you have such a high profile and everyone\u2019s trying to dictate the narrative.\n\nOverall it was fun!\n\nRating: 3.75/5\n\nThank you @atriabooks @bookclubfavorites for the gifted copy!", "total_engagement": 7, "engagement_rate": 0.0005403319181783095, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-08T21:34:14.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "end", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "romance", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teen sitcom", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "liv", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "role", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "cast", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "full house &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "atriabooks"}, {"name": "bookclubfavorites"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039597371, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.457Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.457Z"}, {"id": 607775132039597369, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1457996717", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.455Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.455Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695772, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.185Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.520Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695775, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.189Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.531Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175156632794, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CoiVsDPyL6A/", "post_id": "3036084484920884864", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/943338ee02721c7570500c356956f23f.JPEG", "phash": "a55cc86fd0879770", "image_entities": [{"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9101645350456238}, {"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7380912899971008}, {"entity": "cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.26110291481018066}, {"entity": "pottery", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20013071596622467}, {"entity": "flowerpot", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8138529062271118}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7865622043609619}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6366998553276062}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.611122190952301}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5771902799606323}, {"entity": "tableware", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.37184756994247437}, {"entity": "canned packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3273759186267853}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2924777567386627}, {"entity": "canned packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21991075575351715}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-05T23:55:23.289Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:04:10.630Z"}}], "post_text": "THE HOUSE IN THE PINES - Book review!\n\nI was so excited and had high-ish expectations for this because the synopsis sounded promising and it was a Reese\u2019s Book Club pick\u2026 but ultimately I don\u2019t think the execution was all there and it ended up falling flat.\n\nFirst, we have the unreliable narrator in Maya. This isn\u2019t always my favorite trope because it\u2019s so overused at this point, but sometimes if it\u2019s tame enough it does\u2019 bother me. Maya, however, felt like she was written to be in your face about it and her drug and alcohol abuse got really tiresome and repetitive. I completely understand her history and she was having withdrawals that was affecting her, but she just felt like a lot.\n\nThen there was the way the story was split into two timelines. It never explicitly differentiated when it shifted from past to present (like with a chapter heading) and while I get it may have been a stylistic choice to draw parallels between the two times, it became confusing to recall where you were at. Plus the pacing felt off where some parts were very quick to get through and others seemed slower.\n\nAnd then the ending! I personally was super underwhelmed because even thought it was pretty obvious early on what Frank was up to, the revelations still were not satisfying and it felt like nothing was really solved and all the questions I did have weren\u2019t answered at all. I also thought and wished for more about the book/ story Maya\u2019s father wrote and it seemed like the author intended for it to be a focal point to the story, but ultimately it didn\u2019t add anything extra.\n\nI will say that this book was very atmospheric which is something that I do always enjoy while reading! The psychological elements and the concepts in which this story brought up were fascinating and certainly made me think which I also liked. Maya\u2019s background and Guatemalan heritage and the way she\u2019s tried to stay connected with it was also something I appreciated, though again, I do wish there was a little more.\n\nThis was a quick read though and I did enjoy the psychological elements and thought that went into those parts!!\n\nRating: 2.5/5", "total_engagement": 16, "engagement_rate": 0.0012350443844075646, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-11T21:04:56.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "expectations", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "house", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "maya", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "trope", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9345154762268066}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039597406, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.554Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.554Z"}, {"id": 607775132039597405, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-825796722", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.553Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.553Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695779, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.206Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.555Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695780, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.209Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.563Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175156632764, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ConrEfSgsgH/", "post_id": "3037585898159130631", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/4973e142305ffb4a53f4ab22c5999135.JPEG", "phash": "e1c39eb48d939c98", "image_entities": [{"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9998610019683838}, {"entity": "bookcase", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9983187913894653}, {"entity": "furniture", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9970689415931702}, {"entity": "library", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8765758275985718}, {"entity": "novel", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7058060765266418}, {"entity": "publication", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6101148128509521}, {"entity": "shelf", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5640854835510254}, {"entity": "shelving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.463001012802124}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5277425050735474}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5099213719367981}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.45995283126831055}, {"entity": "staircase", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.410872220993042}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3457464575767517}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3384283185005188}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.326347291469574}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3261876702308655}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.28156259655952454}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2568177282810211}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21830224990844727}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T00:29:00.670Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:03:23.387Z"}}], "post_text": "Very much behind on sharing the book mail I\u2019ve received so far this year, so I figured the start of a new week is as good of a day as ever to celebrate books!\n\nThere are so many fantastic books in this pile that are already out or soon to be released that I cannot wait for!

First there\u2019s Tova-- her son's disappearance into the ocean 30 years ago remains a mystery. Now, in her 70s, she works the night shift at the local aquarium in Sowell Bay. There she befriends the aging Great Pacific octopus, Marcellus. Then there\u2019s Cameron-- a man who grew up without any inkling of who his father was and who\u2019s mother abandoned him as a child. After getting a lead on his father, Cameron finds himself in Sowell Bay. The last (and my fave) narrator is... Marcellus the octopus.\n\nThe beginning was a tiny bit slow and I was curious how the narratives would tie together. But I do think it ended up working well to establish the characters and set up the story because once it all started to blend, this book shined!\n\nThere\u2019s also a lot of dramatic irony where the reader (much in part thanks to Marcellus) knows more than our characters. And because of that it sometimes has you going \u201coh come on!\u201d and it may come off a tad frustrating. There were definitely moments I wanted to knock some sense into Cameron especially, but ultimately it\u2019s a necessary journey the characters needed to make for themselves.\n\nI also appreciated how much I learned about octopi and how intelligent they truly are. Marcellus was written in the best and most charming way to really encapsulate that. His chapters and dialogue were so clever and had me chuckling because he had such a fun perspective on situations! He\u2019s definitely up there as being one of the most wholesome characters ever. (Along with Rocky \ud83e\udd29)\n\nThis was just one of those feel-good reads that covers things such as grief, family, second chances, finding your path in life, etc. Plus it also made me think about topics like animal captivity and the ethics behind it.\n\nOverall this was just very endearing filled with a little drama, a hint of suspense, but mostly carried a lot of heart and kindness within its pages. The ending was sweet and not over the top, but the perfect conclusion for this unique story and each character\u2019s journey.\n\nRating: 4.5/5", "total_engagement": 24, "engagement_rate": 0.001852566576611347, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-17T22:03:35.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lot", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "cameron", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tova", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ocean", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "marcellus", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "journey", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039597529, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.819Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.819Z"}, {"id": 607775132039597527, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "990034318", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.817Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:35.817Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695796, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.270Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.662Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695798, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.273Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.669Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175163788336, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Co5lcW9SzYF/", "post_id": "3042627699782399493", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/ac509ea26d8c795b9424c00102a201f4.JPEG", "phash": "b8f226c1676c66b4", "image_entities": [{"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.775083065032959}, {"entity": "cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6303350329399109}, {"entity": "teacup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30969005823135376}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7004141807556152}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5319796204566956}, {"entity": "football", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5011435747146606}, {"entity": "soccer ball", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4290344715118408}, {"entity": "mug", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4230651557445526}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4052455425262451}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22342388331890106}, {"entity": "tableware", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2147158831357956}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T00:16:59.441Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:05:35.456Z"}}], "post_text": "BLACK CAKE - Book review!\n\nSometimes you just need a messy family drama and BLACK CAKE certainly fit that bill! After seeing great reviews of this book, I finally decided that it was about time to pick up my own copy!\n\nThis is a generational family saga with the story beginning in the present after Benny and Byron\u2019s mother, Eleanor Bennett has passed. The siblings have had a fraught relationship since an incident eight years ago and one of Eleanor\u2019s final wishes is for the two of them to listen to a recording she made explaining the family\u2019s history and then share a piece of black cake\u2014 a traditional Jamaican delicacy\u2014 when the time is right.\n\nThe story is not told in a linear timeline and instead bounces back and forth between the present and different times in the past to align with Eleanor\u2019s recording. The central story is about a girl named Covey, who grew up in the Caribbean islands and what became of her. I did find Covey\u2019s story to be interesting, though heartbreaking at the same time.\n\nAs the story continues and you learn more about what happened to Covey, you start to understand more of the family dynamics of the Bennett family both in the past and present. You can also see how Eleanor\u2019s tale of Covey affects both her children and provides them with a new perspective on their mother, culture, and upbringing.\n\nI did admittedly have some trouble following along with the aforementioned non-linear style of writing. At times it jumped quite a bit where it felt a bit disjointed for my liking. Plus, there seemed to be a lot of different characters and side stories that were introduced and I found myself more compelled by certain plot lines than others. It all did come together and wrapped up nicely in the end though!\n\nLastly, I genuinely appreciated and enjoyed learning so much about life in the Carribean and just a lot of the history behind it because there was so much I didn\u2019t know. I especially liked how the author used black cake as a centerpiece to the story to each generation brought up!\n\nWhile I may not have loved this, I still think it was a great debut with excellent themes and I will be curious to see what the author releases next!\n\nRating: 3.5/5", "total_engagement": 15, "engagement_rate": 0.0011578541103820917, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at":

group of young female writers are invited to an excusing writing retreat at famous author, Roza Vallo\u2019s secluded mansion in upstate New York. Our MC, Alex, is one of these individuals and she is determined to write something great with the help of her most beloved author and finally become published. But things don\u2019t seem to be as grand as she hoped for being that she\u2019s stuck on the retreat with her ex best friend and on top of that, things begin to get strange.\n\nWhile the first half of the book felt a bit slower, it did a good job of setting the foundation and building up a sense of unease and anticipation because you knew something was bound to happen and it was inevitable for the pin to finally drop. And once it did\u2026 it was explosive!\n\nThere were so many twists and turns that I truly had a hard time predicting where this story was headed. On top of that, you could never really trust any of the characters so it made everything even more tense and really gave off some of those locked room vibes. But don\u2019t worry, the psychopaths eventually reveal themselves and their end game and oh boy does it get intense!\n\nThis book was also much more dark and disturbing than I anticipated where at times it felt very much horror like even with some gothic and paranormal feels to it. I can\u2019t remember the last time I felt this creeped out by a book, but this one definitely did it for me at times!\n\nAside from the main overarching story in itself, there was also some interesting plot points that came up throughout the course of the story. Some were unexpected and it took a little bit to grow on me, but by the end I felt that it all made sense and helped add an extra layer to the story, specifically regarding self growth and discovery.\n\nIf you\u2019re on the hunt for a chilling psychological thriller, don\u2019t miss out on this one!\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThanks so much @atriabooks for the gifted digital copy!", "total_engagement": 23, "engagement_rate": 0.0017753763025858743, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-23T22:13:18.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "writing retreat", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "writers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "writing retreat", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mansion", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "group", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "alex", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "psychopaths", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "atriabooks"}], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9605523943901062}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039597644, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.084Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.084Z"}, {"id": 607775132039597643, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-662810673", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.082Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.082Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695818, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.332Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.764Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695822, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.336Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.770Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175169147044, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CpJCeWIy86t/", "post_id": "3046977504340070061", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/c4b99fc77988d3250328fed1e639df55.JPEG", "phash": "fada9462c4b44e1d", "image_entities": [{"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5172632932662964}, {"entity": "cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.37958425283432007}, {"entity": "food", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24537943303585052}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7759575247764587}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6870956420898438}, {"entity": "mug", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.456590473651886}, {"entity": "canned packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4116578698158264}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.31233373284339905}, {"entity": "turtle", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.28161877393722534}, {"entity": "tableware", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2348930686712265}, {"entity": "ring", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20091545581817627}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T00:56:36.665Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:07:46.185Z"}}], "post_text": "CHECK, PLEASE - Series review!\n\nHappy Sunday! Last night was a HUGE day as a Sharks hockey fan as they retired the very first number in franchise history of a legendary Shark. And I definitely bawled my eyes out.\n\nIn honor of that, I figured today would be a great time to (finally) share some thoughts of the CHECK, PLEASE graphic novel series that I completed back in January! Because hockey plus the second one includes a few Sharks cameos!\n\nThis series follows Eric \u201cBitty\u201d, a former figure skating champion, blogger, and baker, as he takes on the challenge of competing on his college\u2019s hockey team. It covers all four years of his time on the team, the dynamics between the players, the life of a college athlete (the parties, the mental aspect, etc), and so much more.\n\nI just adored this series for so many reasons! First, I loved so many of the characters and the relationships they had with each other. There\u2019s Bitty and his wholesomeness, Shitty and his hilarity, Jack and his broodiness, and plenty of others who add so much character to the story. It depicted not only their competitive/ athletic side, but also showcased the \u201cbro-y\u201d side of hockey culture which is VERY much a thing, but I won\u2019t delve into that.\n\nThen there\u2019s the romance aspect which was sweet and I loved how supportive all the teammates were of Bitty and Jack. Though they each faced their own struggles, their story made me smile and I loved rooting for them.\n\nAs for the panels themselves, I was super impressed with the details of the illustrations! The dialogue was so fun and made me laugh several time. Though, I will say there were some times where it was a bit hard to properly follow the panels, otherwise I thought it was all very well done!\n\nOverall, it\u2019s safe to say that I enjoyed this graphic novel series. It was so heartwarming, cute, and made me want all the baked goods! Plus I felt like I could read about this characters forever because they were such a fun group and I loved following their journey!\n\nSeries Rating: 4.5/5", "total_engagement": 13, "engagement_rate": 0.0010034735623311462, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-26T21:47:25.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "jack", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "number", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "times", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "series", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "characters", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "eric bitty", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hockey fan", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "honor", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "eyes", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "many", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "others", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thoughts", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039597703, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.186Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.186Z"}, {"id": 607775132039597696, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1827432441", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.173Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.173Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695827, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.354Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.792Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695828, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.358Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.799Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175169147043, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CpOc3nsPAla/", "post_id": "3048500965267999066", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/21deed45eaa41e0235a276601bf85173.JPEG", "phash": "b80738211f7a776c", "image_entities": [{"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7926077842712402}, {"entity": "handwriting", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.673983097076416}, {"entity": "protest", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6678311824798584}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.42968517541885376}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9613220691680908}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8875696659088135}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5489403009414673}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-05T23:46:20.136Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:07:27.148Z"}}], "post_text": "ALL GOOD PEOPLE HERE - Book review!\n\nI feel like this book has made its fair share of rounds on the internet ever since it\u2019s release last year and it was one where I felt like I didn\u2019t need to give into the temptation, but when I happened to see it stocked at my local library\u2026 I thought, why not? And so here we are!\n\nThe synopsis of this sounded interesting enough\u2014 a thriller/ suspense taking place in a small town where twenty years a go, a young girl was kidnapped and murdered, but the case went unsolved. Now, Margot has returned to her hometown to take care of her uncle (and only father figure she\u2019s known) who is suffering from early onset dementia. Upon her return, another young girl is murdered and Margot uses her journalistic drive to try and figure out once and for all what happened twenty years ago and if what\u2019s happening now is the same person.\n\nThe story is told in two timelines through two different POVs. There\u2019s Krissy, the teenager we see turn into an adult who loses her daughter that fateful night in the past. And then of course we have Margot who is on the hunt for answers. While I found both timelines to be captivating enough to each hold my attention, I think my biggest gripe was with the characters themselves. I didn\u2019t find them to be fleshed out and developed enough and honestly, I just didn\u2019t really like them. Sure, they\u2019re not the most black and white characters, but some of their actions rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nWhile the book does have its twists in it, I didn\u2019t find them to be the most shocking and it felt like a couple of the earlier hunches I may have had ended up being right. Plus there was one part of the plot line where it felt like everything was just so convenient and I wasn\u2019t a fan of it. Also, I don\u2019t mind ambiguous endings, but this one was just a bit too much for me and it literally just ended and had me going \u201creally, that\u2019s it?\u201d\n\nOverall, it was a quick and fast paced read and I think the author has a knack for writing a compelling story\u2014 even if it is eerily similar to real life cases. I just think I\u2019ve read plenty of other books of this genre that were executed a bit better.\n\nRating: 3/5", "total_engagement": 3, "engagement_rate": 0.00023157082207641837, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-01T00:14:15.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "margot", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "krissy", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "town", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "girl", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "share", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "release", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rounds", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "internet", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.958697497844696}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039597725, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.265Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.265Z"}, {"id": 607775132039597723, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1714351642", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.264Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.264Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695834, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.373Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.819Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695836, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.377Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.829Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175169147042, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CpTKOgkvaSH/", "post_id": "3049826350173889671", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/94b971389c2f1543069a3c456a58ac26.JPEG", "phash": "d275212ea2446feb", "image_entities": [{"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8161753416061401}, {"entity": "bookcase", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4976619780063629}, {"entity": "bookselling", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.45701393485069275}, {"entity": "library", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3101877272129059}, {"entity": "publication", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.29913243651390076}, {"entity": "shelf", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23341725766658783}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8174504637718201}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22125659883022308}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T00:52:35.150Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:06:55.713Z"}}], "post_text": "LOVE IN THE TIME OF SERIAL KILLERS - Book review!\n\nI\u2019ve been intrigued by this book since it\u2019s release late last summer. I mean come on, just take a look at the title\u2014 how fun is that for a contemporary romance?!\n\nThe story started out great and I was hooked by the premise and our MC, Phoebe\u2019s, fascination for true crime and serial killers. Not only was the scene set for a love story, but you could absolutely tell that family and grief were also going to be a big part of the plot.\n\nI genuinely enjoyed the first bit of the story where Phoebe has some off the wall encounters with her neighbor, Sam, that are strange enough that some part of her thinks he might be a serial killer. Eventually, she realizes that might not be the case and instead, he could actually be\u2026 a good guy. Their romance starts off feeling like a slow burn which I truly didn\u2019t mind at all, because it was filled with sweet moments and some tension. But then as the story progresses and when they finally get together, that lust and spark faded for me and I just felt like I didn\u2019t really care for the relationship anymore and in some ways, it felt stale.\n\nThe other theme of the story that I did appreciate was the relationship Phoebe had with her younger brother, Conner. Phoebe\u2019s childhood and adolescence was marred by fighting parents who eventually split leaving each of the parents with a child. This in turn caused Phoebe to have an even more fractured relationship with her father and also grow apart from her brother. Now, her father\u2019s recent death has resurfaced some feelings from the past and it was interesting to see her correlate her love for true crime with her upbringing. And as for Conner, it was nice to see the two siblings reconnect as adults and really establish t themselves as family.\n\nLastly, there were definitely a lot of pop and nostalgia-like references which made things fun and relatable! But at times was also a lot.\n\nOverall it was a quirky yet fairly standard read and even thought I may not have loved it, I\u2019m still glad I finally read it!\n\nRating: 3/5", "total_engagement": 10, "engagement_rate": 0.0007719027402547279, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-02T20:07:34.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "romance", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "relationship", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "look", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "love", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "serial killer", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sam", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "conner", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "release", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "phoebe", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "serial killers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fun", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "part", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039597769, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.350Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.350Z"}, {"id": 607775132039597766, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1871400038", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.348Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.348Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695842, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.394Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.852Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695846, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.398Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.858Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175177834703, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CpYeDxKSoeB/", "post_id": "3051320947883280257", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/db87dd8068f205afb4e156ed87cc6787.JPEG", "phash": "f2c0cd0cdea7d09a", "image_entities": [{"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9999581575393677}, {"entity": "bookcase", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9985620379447937}, {"entity": "furniture", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9983660578727722}, {"entity": "library", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9975676536560059}, {"entity": "publication", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9957078695297241}, {"entity": "room", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.987754762172699}, {"entity": "shelf", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9860089421272278}, {"entity": "bookselling", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9685950875282288}, {"entity": "public library", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5450075268745422}, {"entity": "shelving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3596929609775543}, {"entity": "bookcase", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7435188293457031}, {"entity": "bookcase", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7353532910346985}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-05T23:52:26.015Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:09:04.970Z"}}], "post_text": "A Saturday shelfie because it has been WAAAY too long since I\u2019ve had one on my feed.

tiny bit misleading. Twenty five years ago, Jenna, Donnie, and Nico were friends at Savior House\u2014 a place for orphaned teens that held its own horrors. One night they do something terrible that has stuck with them since. Now in the present, they are about to be forced back together to reckon with the truth and confront the past.\n\nSounds interesting in theory, and while all that DID happen, it occurred in a way I wasn\u2019t ready for. I expected a typical thriller with narratives woven together to tell the story and create suspense. Instead, this was an extremely action packed story filled with hits and assassins.\n\nThis book was very much action driven rather than plot or character. One thing kept happening after the other that it was like reading a Jason Bourne story. Because of that, I felt like the plot suffered and I did wish for more character development because in the end, I didn\u2019t really care too much about anyone.\n\nThis book is also split into four POVs\u2014 the three aforementioned friends and one that appears about a third of the way in (which is an entirely different story on its own). I was most enamored by Jenna, even though so many elements of her background were far fetched. The other two, I could never find myself invested in. Aside from the switching POVs, there also were timeline jumps\u2026 right in the middle of the dang chapter or basically with no warning! So it got me very confused sometimes. Like I need a heading or at least a paragraph break.\n\nThe fourth POV was interesting, but not fully fleshed out enough for my liking. It just felt off and random and instead its like it was thrown in to create more action and an enemy. Side note: the amount of times a pipe weapon was mentioned got grating.\n\nI will say the non-stop action and quick chapters, made this read quickly and I was captured enough to want to get to the end and figure out what happened and who betrayed who.\n\nIf assassin stories are your thing, then check it out! Out now!\n\nRating: 3/5\n\nThanks @minotaur books for my copy and personalized necklace!", "total_engagement": 14, "engagement_rate": 0.001080663836356619, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-07T23:44:33.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "truth", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teens", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nico", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "friends", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "place", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "action", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "jenna", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "minotaur"}], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9675822257995605}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039597867, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.583Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.583Z"}, {"id": 607775132039597865, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "693640550", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.581Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.581Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695861, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.471Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.948Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695862, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.476Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:42.955Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175177834697, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cpi2PUGg66n/", "post_id": "3054242044198497959", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/8e197ba7c16122383c401e650fcbb71a.JPEG", "phash": "f6c2881fd3282ef2", "image_entities": [{"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5977086424827576}, {"entity": "paper", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3942343294620514}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22603128850460052}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6726729273796082}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5613911151885986}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5343192219734192}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5002983212471008}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4224947690963745}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3957598805427551}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.27367836236953735}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.27146726846694946}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2692294418811798}, {"entity": "canned packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23556971549987793}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T00:03:18.750Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:08:23.942Z"}}], "post_text": "Happy International Women\u2019s Day!

Those with short strings will be meeting their fate sooner while those with longer ones will go on to have a longer life. As you can imagine, if something like this were to happen the world and society might descend into chaos and lead to a whole new way of living.\n\nThe story follows along eight strangers and how they each handle the situation and the fate of their strings. I found the development and concept to be so unique and intriguing! Right from the beginning it made you question what YOU would do if this occurred and so much more. It made you really think about the value of life and made you look at things from different perspectives as we followed along each character and their decisions.\n\nThe discourse brought up around short vs long stringers was so interesting to follow and it did bring up a political aspect that played a role in how the story progressed. There were definitely moments where this book was super frustrating because of one particular character\u2019s actions and views on certain matters. On the contrary, there were other moments that made me believe that humanity can prevail and emphasized that there are genuinely just GOOD people out there regardless of their circumstances or the scenarios they find themselves in.\n\nWhile I did really enjoy this, it wasn\u2019t quite a five star because I did feel that something was missing in the end for me, though I can\u2019t quite place my finger on it.\n\nIf you're looking for a fairly quick yet super thought provoking read, I highly recommend! It was a debut too which makes me even more excited to see what this author has coming up next!\n\nRating: 4/5", "total_engagement": 31, "engagement_rate": 0.0023928984947896564, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-14T22:36:03.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nothing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "everybody", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reason", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "world", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reviews", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "box", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bookstagram", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "strangers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bit", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "moments", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9792623519897461}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039597987, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.928Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.928Z"}, {"id": 607775132039597985, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1398029789", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.927Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:36.927Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695880, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.534Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.036Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695881, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.540Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.044Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175182900696, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp8oLLqvffb/", "post_id": "3061498537008035803", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/d8c4632bc115512c539a2614815ee22c.JPEG", "phash": "c0a13b835ada9ccf", "image_entities": [{"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5422230958938599}, {"entity": "fashion", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4618517756462097}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3510882258415222}, {"entity": "shoulder", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3128182590007782}, {"entity": "white", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24833284318447113}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7163094878196716}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6738795638084412}, {"entity": "bow", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2940773367881775}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.26493775844573975}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.25430431962013245}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.25126713514328003}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21033702790737152}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2005164474248886}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T00:34:54.692Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:11:44.422Z"}}], "post_text": "ICEBREAKER - Book review!\n\nI\u2019m sure you may have seen this book on your feed\u2026 I know I have! I was lucky enough to receive a copy and was dying to know what the hype was about especially because it had hockey! And enemies to lovers!\n\nSadly, it ended up falling flat for so many different reasons.\n\nFirst there's the length. Personally, I don\u2019t like my romance books to be more than 400 pages. If it is, it\u2019s got to really impress and be a great story! Unfortunately, this came in at 430. Paired with the fact I struggled with the writing, it felt even longer because I just couldn't get engaged and found it disjointed. On top of that, the plot point of Nate and Anastasia partnering as a skating duo didn't happen until 200+ pages in! And then there were only like three scenes!\n\nThat leads me into the plot of this book which wasn\u2019t that existent? It just felt so repetitive: the'd party, hook up, have some drama, and repeat. Plus, I felt like a lot of the situations were a bit far fetched for college students. Although, it was mentioned how uber rich a few were so I guess it makes sense they\u2019re able to throw massive ragers and go out to fancy restaurants like its normal? Anyway, there really wasn\u2019t much hockey at all which made me sad. \n\nAnother grievance I had was the characters, mainly Anastasia. I hated how she treated Nate, especially early on. She was so hot and cold for no reason other than it being like a game to her and it came off very immature. Plus she seemed so hypocritical with the things she\u2019d express vs. how she\u2019d act and it was tiresome.\n\nI did appreciate how the author wasn\u2019t afraid to add uncomfortable topics like mental health, eating disorders, consent, and more. However at the same time I felt like she was trying to include everything and it became too much. While I also enjoyed some of the team aspects, there were a ton of side characters and little plots so it became hard to track.\n\nLastly, this book was SPICY which I didn\u2019t mind.. But also maybe just a tad too many scenes (I go back to my repetitive point).\n\nOverall this was a huge miss and I didn\u2019t even mention the epilogue! Oh well, on to the next!\n\nRating: 2/5", "total_engagement": 15, "engagement_rate": 0.0011578541103820917, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-18T22:38:07.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "anastasia", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nate", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "author", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hype", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "romance books", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "length", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "pages", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "copy", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9611430764198303}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039598029, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:37.023Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:37.023Z"}, {"id": 607775132039598026, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1596211403", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:37.020Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:37.020Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695888, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.563Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.067Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695890, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.567Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.075Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175182900694, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CqB2dNlPV_P/", "post_id": "3062968723548495823", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/9aef646a46bd6585e1ae9f95ec18af49.JPEG", "phash": "d3b55db05ab4bc10", "image_entities": [{"entity": "collection", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4377554655075073}, {"entity": "convenience food", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3755035698413849}, {"entity": "advertisement", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.32223254442214966}, {"entity": "paper", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.293748140335083}, {"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.26325055956840515}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20939083397388458}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5954993367195129}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4680132269859314}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.35487398505210876}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.33662325143814087}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.32580122351646423}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.31405729055404663}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3097628057003021}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.28562256693840027}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.28203272819519043}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.27866244316101074}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2620413899421692}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24322263896465302}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20410963892936707}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-05T23:38:00.907Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:11:19.870Z"}}], "post_text": "Happy Monday and happy first day of spring! \ud83d\udc90 \n\nKicking off what will be an eventful week by sharing some long overdue book mail!\n\nThere are a plethora of exciting titles here, some of which I\u2019ve already read, but several that I haven\u2019t.

At the age of 25, Elsa finds herself wanting to experience life and after a rendezvous with Rafe, she finds her life completely changed.\n\nFast forward a few years to the early 1930s and the rough Dust Bowl Era and Elsa is living on the Martinelli farm with her two young children and in a marriage that\u2019s always had unrequited love.\n\nOne of our favorite things about the story was how much we learned about this time in American history and understanding the struggles. The writing and situations were very raw and didn\u2019t shy away from the atrocities of the time. Reading about how insane and dangerous the dust storms were was so eye opening! And to think it was all less than 100 years ago and due to poor farming!\n\nEventually after Rafe abandons the family, Elsa and her children set off west to California in hopes of a better life and to escape the harsh environment of the Texas Panhandle. Their journey and subsequent time in California is no better and again, gaining insight to the tragedies that were so normal for that era was heartbreaking and it definitely provided lots of room for discussion.\n\nWhile the story did move along at a slower pace, especially at the beginning, we all agreed that it was still an interesting story. As mentioned, it doesn\u2019t sugar coat anything and was definitely a sad read with very few uplifting moments. It also made us question what we do if we were living back then and it gave us appreciation for how things have changed.\n\nThe ending was admittedly not everyone\u2019s favorite because what happened, happened so quickly that the satisfying aspect of it never was able to sink in. And I would say maybe about half teared up.\n\nOverall though, it was enjoyed by everyone and really did make for a great book club book because we talked about things like the American Dream, unions (and communism), sexism, motherhood, and so much more.\n\nGroup rating: 4/5", "total_engagement": 20, "engagement_rate": 0.0015438054805094559, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-23T22:15:11.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "family", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sense", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rafe", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9408829212188721}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039598080, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:37.206Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:37.206Z"}, {"id": 607775132039598078, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1567340936", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:37.204Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:37.204Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695904, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.603Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.144Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695905, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.606Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.152Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175187951332, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CqbND3cv5by/", "post_id": "3070105011284317938", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/f2c24db8fbe62652c6faf23e7037f855.JPEG", "phash": "a5e865be8a03f6d0", "image_entities": [{"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9765393733978271}, {"entity": "bookcase", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8563764095306396}, {"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.805888295173645}, {"entity": "cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3809831738471985}, {"entity": "publication", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.36648520827293396}, {"entity": "mug", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6258788108825684}, {"entity": "computer monitor", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.41922566294670105}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.36971598863601685}, {"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20904801785945892}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-05T23:58:44.488Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:12:32.013Z"}}], "post_text": "Happy almost Friday, friends!\n\nThe last week has been a doozy and I still feel like I\u2019m getting back into my normal rhythm and catching up on sleep\u2026 but I\u2019m back to posting!\n\nMy previous seven days or so included: road tripping to Southern California, wedding prep, back to back weddings on consecutive nights (with an early morning flight in between), wine tasting and more.

I love me a good thriller/ suspense, but just never got around to reading one of her backlist titles.\n\nThis book begins when a woman seems to have jumped to her own death at a known suicide spot (The Drop), that also happens to be in the backyard of Pippa and her family\u2019s new coastal home. Pippa\u2019s husband, Gabe, has successfully talked people off the edge prior to this incident, but was unable to do so this time around. At first it seems like an open and shut case, but soon Pippa learn\u2019s that Gabe knew the woman and the dominoes begin to fall.\n\nI definitely was expecting more of your typical fast paced thriller, and though it was a quick and bingeworthy read, it felt like it leaned a bit more towards a domestic drama rather than thriller. I can\u2019t concisely explain what I mean by it, but it just didn\u2019t feel as thrilling as it could\u2019ve been. Nevertheless, the short chapters along with the dual timelines and POVs did keep my engaged because I was eager to find out how everything came together and what led to that moment at The Drop.\n\nAs for the characters, I didn\u2019t find any of the four main individuals to be particularly likable, but they also weren\u2019t terrible. I just felt like I couldn\u2019t connect to any of them. But with that being said, they all had morally grey aspects to them. They may have done some terrible things, yet in some ways you could understand why they did them.\n\nThis story also touches quite a bit on mental illness and how it can creep up on you, but also what it\u2019s like to live with someone with a diagnosis and how it affects relationships and families. It was interesting and brought up some thoughtful topics, but there were some moments where it felt like it was just.. a lot.\n\nAnyway, I did speed through this one and it was fine! There was nothing super special about it, but I did like how it kept me guessing and there was one little twist at the end. Overall, a good read and I\u2019m curious now to check out Sally Hepworth\u2019s previous books.\n\nRating: 3.5/5", "total_engagement": 14, "engagement_rate": 0.001080663836356619, "network_type":

I had this on hold at my library for a bit and was stoked when it finally came in that I had to jump right in\u2026 and I\u2019m pleased that for the most part, this one actually lived up to some of its hype!\n\nI will preface by saying the story and its plot felt fairly reminiscent to some other books I\u2019ve read, one in particular (no title because spoilers!). But despite that, I still found this enjoyable and very entertaining. A popcorn thriller at its finest!\n\nThe book is split into three parts and the first introduces us to Millie. One of our MC\u2019s who recently was released from a 10 year jail sentence and has found work as a live-in maid with the wealthy Winchester family. At first everything seems to good to be true, but after only being around a very short time, the matriarch of the house, Nina, begins to treat Millie terribly and her moods seemingly shift all the time. With no choice but to stick around, Millie puts up with Nina while also finding some solidarity with her husband, Andrew. \n\nWhile I don\u2019t want to say too much about what else occurs, I will say that the author did an excellent job at painting the picture of the perfect enemy in Nina. She was quite cruel in her treatment of Millie and it took me some time to wrap my head around it. As the story progressed though, more pieces of Nina\u2019s past came to light and you began to understand.\n\nAside from the apparent battle between Nina and Millie, there\u2019s also another plot line that shows itself roughly midway through the book. This was definitely the twist that was meant to shock everyone and while I wasn\u2019t totally surprised, I was still very intrigued to continue reading and get the full scope of things. And oh man some of the stuff that occurred from that point seemed so sadistic, but like I couldn\u2019t stop reading!\n\nThe ending was satisfying, yet ambiguous enough for the sequel which released fairly recently! I am pretty curious about it so will probably end up reading it eventually.\n\nRating: 4/5", "total_engagement": 15, "engagement_rate": 0.0011578541103820917, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-05T22:20:03.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "andrew", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hold", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "twist", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thriller", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "millie", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reviews", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "housemaid", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "books", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "part", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bit", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "library", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9733723998069763}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039598269, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:37.869Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:37.869Z"}, {"id": 607775132039598267, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1872680633", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:37.867Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:37.867Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695925, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.691Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.261Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695928, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.695Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.268Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175193923935, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqtb387PKoB/", "post_id": "3075236712809277953", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/899530b96998c8660de826be8651ae30.JPEG", "phash": "e9476618b7b0d24b", "image_entities": [{"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9930661916732788}, {"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.926862895488739}, {"entity": "cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6122164130210876}, {"entity": "pink", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2172410786151886}, {"entity": "sunglasses", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9429452419281006}, {"entity": "picture frame", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7889480590820312}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5360767245292664}, {"entity": "computer monitor", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4796595871448517}, {"entity": "soccer ball", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4558923542499542}, {"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3724285662174225}, {"entity": "clock tower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.33124592900276184}, {"entity": "tableware", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.30647698044776917}, {"entity": "mobile phone", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23582790791988373}, {"entity": "football", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.227656289935112}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22005462646484375}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-13T01:06:13.050Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:13:24.739Z"}}], "post_text": "MEET ME AT THE LAKE - Book review!\n\nThis sophomore book from the author of EVERY SUMMER AFTER has the makings of being another big hit\u2026 but I feel like my thoughts will be on the unpopular side \ud83e\udee3\n\nI\u2019ll start with some of the things that I enjoyed, the first being the atmosphere and setting! It takes place in Ontario and you get a wonderful mix of being the lake (Muskoka) and city (Toronto). And as someone who loves lots of things Canada\u2014 I adored this! I also liked the themes such as grief/ loss, finding yourself, happiness, etc and thought these moments were well written and honest. Also, really appreciated a lot of the secondary characters!\n\nSo what didn\u2019t I like? Sadly, it was the romance piece itself which being a romance book\u2026 is a lot. The story switches between present and flashbacks and you learn that at the age of 22, Fern and Will spent one day together and then never spoke again. In the ten years since, there was a broken promise, but otherwise zero communication. When Will crashes back into Fern\u2019s life they get their second-chance, but I had difficulty really connecting and rooting for a them because I had a hard time buying into the fact these two could suddenly pick up where they left off and be in love. Also the development wasn't quite there for me. Unfortunately the fated-lovers & insta-love trope has never been for me, but its great if it works for others!\n\nI also was never a huge fan of Fern. Some of her behavior and actions, particularly later in the story didn\u2019t bode well with me and its almost like she came off a bit pretentious.\n\nLastly, without going on a long spiel, I wanted to mention this story has a lot of emotional cheating and is fairly prevalent in Fern and Will\u2019s backstory. While I understand this may be much more common and \u201cinnocent\u201d than the physical kind, something about it felt icky to me particularly because of some of the criticism ESA received. I personally didn\u2019t think the story needed it to help move it along and would've been fine without it. But that's me.\n\nWhile I didn\u2019t end up loving this, I\u2019m positive plenty will and find it perfect for the summer season!\n\nRating: 2.5/5\n\nThanks @berkleyromance for the arc, out 5/2!",

There\u2019s a bit of mystery, magical realism, and tenderness so far and I can\u2019t wait to dive in more this afternoon.\n\nWhat have you been reading this weekend?", "total_engagement": 18, "engagement_rate": 0.0013894249324585101, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-09T20:17:46.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "everyone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sun", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "list", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mystery", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "flowers", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "easter", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "realism", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "california", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "books", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039598341, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:38.046Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:38.046Z"}, {"id": 607775132039598340, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "664668015", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:38.045Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:38.045Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695937, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.733Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.321Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695938, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.737Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.327Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175197511299, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq83SIfvA7k/", "post_id": "3079579383845621476", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/6e92824885b6643f400cec60f78a2643.JPEG", "phash": "c30874119b749fde", "image_entities": [{"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8913825750350952}, {"entity": "aisle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7984575629234314}, {"entity": "bookcase", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7333788871765137}, {"entity": "library", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.507304847240448}, {"entity": "bookselling", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.46643269062042236}, {"entity": "product", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4619714021682739}, {"entity": "publication", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34603720903396606}, {"entity": "retail", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.26894450187683105}, {"entity": "convenience store", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.25753018260002136}, {"entity": "public library", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23714382946491241}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22922156751155853}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7897392511367798}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7622045278549194}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4382297992706299}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-20T22:32:48.266Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:17:37.060Z"}}], "post_text": "THE PERFECT MARRIAGE - Book club review!\n\nFor our most recent book club pick, we decided to go with a domestic thriller\u2014 and after seeing this book ALL over recently, we chose to see what it was all about. I mean, a mistress, a murder, and a court case? Sounds super intriguing! Unfortunately, the hype for this one seemed to fall short for most. \n\nTo start with the positives\u2014 this book read super quickly! There were quick chapters with alternating POVs (and occasionally alternating timelines) and this made for an engaging read because it left most people wanting to find out what the heck happened and who truly was guilty. Plus the legal side of things (while maybe some inaccuracies) was fun too.\n\nHowever, despite the quick pacing there were still a few things that felt very off about this book. One was some of the inconsistencies and plot holes. There were a few situations and issues that were presented that either didn\u2019t make a ton of sense, or were never circled back to later on.\n\nAnother thing (and this was one of my own big issues) was the narrative itself. Both POVs were told in first person perspective which was fine, until you get to the ending twist. Because This book felt like it was trying to mimic another VERY popular read, but the execution just wasn\u2019t quite there because when you actually sit back and think about it, the narrative doesn\u2019t make sense. But maybe that was just me.\n\nAnother thing a lot of us struggled with were the characters themselves, one in particular, because their actions were just so incredibly dumb it had us eye rolling at times. You also have to really suspend disbelief with some of the situations that occur throughout the story.\n\nOverall, this wasn\u2019t a favorite, BUT we did agree that it was still intriguing and twisty enough to hold our attention.

The two don\u2019t get off on the right foot, but eventually the ice breaks through some shared moments, vulnerabilities, and letters and what comes is a sweet and feel-good romance!\n\nThere was so much to adore about this book. But number one on the list is Jacob. You learn very early on that he suffers from social anxiety and I truly appreciated how Abby wrote his character with this. Jacob was just so honest and pure with the best intentions, but he also felt so REAL because of his anxiety and the way he coped and handled it. Briana on the other hand took a little bit to warm up too, but once I did she stood out in her own, flawed way.\n\nWhile the characters were a huge reason I loved this, there was still the story itself I enjoyed. It included fake-dating, a dog, and letter exchanges for an epistolary element! As you can expect from this author, the story wasn\u2019t all just warm and fluffy but delved into some more serious topics such as the aforementioned anxiety, loving yourself, chronic disease, new beginnings, and so much more to make for a powerful read.\n\nThe one thing that held it back from being five stars was some of the miscommunication and Briana\u2019s later actions. The miscommunication did make sense for this narrative in some regard, but at one point it felt like just a tad too much. And then for Briana, she made some rash choices which I had a hard time with, but I guess it made sense for her character development. And I am glad her issues were addressed in a healthy way.\n\nOverall, if you\u2019re an Abby fan, get excited for this one!\n\nRating: 4.5/5\n\nThanks @readforeverpub for the gifted digital copy!", "total_engagement": 11, "engagement_rate": 0.0008490930142802007, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-19T22:47:10.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "abby jimenez", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "briana", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book boyfriends", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "romance authors", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "jacob", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "companion novel", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "readforeverpub"}], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9908875226974487}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039598566, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:38.902Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:38.902Z"}, {"id": 607775132039598565, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1125569980", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:38.900Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:38.900Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695969, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.841Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.437Z"}, {"id": 607775132175695972, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.845Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.443Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175199501280, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CrT9BYMPN5x/", "post_id": "3086078545210695281", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/952af48f58365bf1471aebb1dcc25cca.JPEG", "phash": "f8af321f5a897882", "image_entities": [{"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9953645467758179}, {"entity": "bookcase", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9944522976875305}, {"entity": "bookselling", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9291752576828003}, {"entity": "furniture", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9160568118095398}, {"entity": "library", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9102052450180054}, {"entity": "publication", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7825183868408203}, {"entity": "shelf", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7274211645126343}, {"entity": "shelving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4751306176185608}, {"entity": "bookstore", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21251490712165833}, {"entity": "computer monitor", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8272398710250854}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5380673408508301}, {"entity": "picture frame", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3539618253707886}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-05-04T00:59:05.227Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:19:24.694Z"}}], "post_text": "IN THE LIVES OF PUPPETS \u2013 Book review!\n\nIf you\u2019re a TJ Klune fan and have enjoyed his past works as much as I have, then get ready because you are in for a treat with his latest!\n\nThis story includes machines vs. humans, found family, love & sexuality, adventure, freedom of choice, BEING BRAVE, and so much more. Also, at different times and for different reasons, it totally gave me Westworld, Tarzan, Star Wars, and Avatar vibes.\n\nAnyway, the premise is that Vic is a human who lives among machines: there\u2019s his dad, Gio, the sociopathic (but still loveable in her own ways) Nurse Ratches, and the overeager vacuum, Rambo. They live in the forest and have created a nice quiet lifestyle. That is until Vic discovers the remnants of a machine in the scrap yard and decides to bring it back to life. Hap soon joins the family and is a complex machine with a brutal past he has no recollection of. However, Hap\u2019s presence changes everything and Gio is taken from the forest revealing secrets of his own creation and leaving Vic and Co. to take off from the comfort of the only home they\u2019ve known and go on a journey to rescue him.\n\nI don\u2019t even know where to begin with this. It was just so full of heart (pun intended) and hope and once the foundation of the story was set, I couldn\u2019t put it down. The found family aspects were wonderful and I loved the relationships Vic, a human, had with the machines and vice versa. Plus it really made you questions things from a new perspective such as humanity, love, memory, and choice.\n\nI also really enjoyed the humor in this one as well! It did include more crude/ sexual innuendos and jokes which may not always be for everyone, but it totally made sense why because this story touched on sexuality and how its not a one size fits all, but more of a spectrum.\n\nWhile there\u2019s so much more I could share about this story, I\u2019ll end it by saying that this book is quite an adventure, but one that will stick with me for a bit.

Because she is back with her next book and as expected, it was wonderful and heartwarming and everything you could imagine in and Emily Henry story.\n\nThe story follows our MC, Harriet, as she joins her two college best friends, their partners, and her ex-fiance (though none of the rest know this yet), for one last hurrah at the Maine cottage they spent so many summers at. During this stay, Harriet is forced to reckon with what happened to her relationship with Wyn and to truly think about what makes her happy in life. Not only does this include a love story with a second chance romance, but it\u2019s also about friendship and the work it takes to maintain them as people begin to move into different phases of life.\n\nFor starters, I adored the setting of this one. It just gave off such cozy and nostalgic summer vibes + I loved how much friendship was a central theme to this setting, so much that it made me think about all the past and future trips I\u2019ve shared with friends! (Ironically enough, I read while on one!)\n\nI also just really appreciated seeing Harriet\u2019s struggle to find happiness and understanding herself through such difficult times like a broken engagement or being dissatisfied with her career or the fact that her \u201chappy place\u201d of the cottage will be non existent soon. It felt very authentic as it was told in two timelines, the past and present, and you got to really understand everything Harriet and the friend group has experienced over the years and how the group dynamic is changing as they each begin to take big life steps such as marriage and children.\n\nAs for the romance piece, I did enjoy following Harriet and Wyn\u2019s journey because it was messy and complicated and choices were made whether it was the right one or not. However, seeing them start to realize why the events of their past transpired felt enlightening and it made me happy even through the dark times.\n\nOverall, I really liked this and I think any Emily Henry fan will well when it officially hits shelves TOMORROW!\n\nRating: 5/5\n\nThanks so much @berkleyromance for the gifted digital copy!", "total_engagement": 36, "engagement_rate": 0.0027788498649170203, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-24T22:36:16.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "everything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fans", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "harriet", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "emily henry", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "friendship", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "friends", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "berkleyromance"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039598717, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.388Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.388Z"}, {"id": 607775132039598716, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1526603110", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.385Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.385Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696002, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.946Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.564Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696005, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.950Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.570Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175199501214, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CrjhRfYPQ5F/", "post_id": "3090460106764914245", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/cec4f4a5a4d538f45c489b2ca2860d3f.JPEG", "phash": "b1ccfc018b639772", "image_entities": [{"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9809797406196594}, {"entity": "cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9047278761863708}, {"entity": "morning", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3276072144508362}, {"entity": "pink", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2821657657623291}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7957325577735901}, {"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7039241790771484}, {"entity": "tableware", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24004830420017242}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-05-04T00:59:05.898Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:18:05.486Z"}}], "post_text": "HOW I\u2019LL KILL YOU - Book review!\n\nOkay... identical triplet sisters who have a habit of alternating kills of their boyfriends, how could not that be interesting to a thriller lover?\n\nThe story is told through the POV of the youngest, Sissy.

She\u2019s always been the \u201ccleaner\u201d of the family and has yet to kill. Meanwhile, her sisters are vastly different and seem to both enjoy the game for their own reasons. Sissy eventually chooses Edison as the man to make fall in love with her before she buries him. But as time ticks down to the inevitable kill, Sissy finds herself second guessing everything including her own sisters.\n\nI will admit the pacing of the story felt a little off. The beginning was very intriguing because you quickly get an idea for each of the triplets\u2019 personality and get glimpses into their dynamic and why they kill for and with each other. You also learn in pieces, their upbringing, how they were split up in different foster homes, and their different experiences within the system. However, I found the middle parts a bit slower. Here, Sissy gets to know Edison more and also begins to truly wonder about her own future and question things about her sisters. \n\nThe ending both explosive and thought provoking. There\u2019s some action that occurs and suspense around what choices Sissy and her sisters will make. In the end, you\u2019re left pondering about identity, family and what it even means or where the line may be drawn when it comes to them. It wasn\u2019t all wrapped up in a nice bow because and I really enjoyed that!\n\nOverall, I had fun with this book and will be curious what the author writes next!\n\nRating: 3.5/5", "total_engagement": 12, "engagement_rate": 0.0009262832883056735, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-27T21:39:35.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "triplets", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "habit", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sisters", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sissy", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "boyfriends", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039598755, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.482Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.482Z"}, {"id": 607775132039598754, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1922249109", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.480Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.480Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696010, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.966Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.595Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696011, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:45.969Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.601Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175199501169, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CrqxEnwJ9J1/", "post_id": "3092499915984065141", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/aafbc53a5d891ac95ca6b78a8b110742.JPEG", "phash": "cb6ff029168b612d", "image_entities": [{"entity": "shelf", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2120216339826584}, {"entity": "bag", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8479393720626831}, {"entity": "bag", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.553499698638916}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5478142499923706}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.49183183908462524}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.42508813738822937}, {"entity": "luggage & bags", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4135216772556305}, {"entity": "luggage & bags", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4076739251613617}, {"entity": "luggage & bags", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3463801145553589}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.31830164790153503}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.27033841609954834}, {"entity": "bag", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.26913759112358093}, {"entity": "handbag", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2626078128814697}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20024211704730988}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-05-04T00:59:06.446Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:17:55.706Z"}}], "post_text": "The magic and joy of walking into an independent bookstore is unrivaled.\n\nI hope everyone had a lovely time celebrating Independent Bookstore Day and had the opportunity visit some bookstores!\n\nI made it out to one of my favorites earlier tin morning, and then had my IRL book club in afternoon, before finishing off the day with a trip to another bookstore to hunt down our next read.\n\nFor fun, I wanted to share some of my own favorite reasons for shopping at independent bookstores:\n\n\ud83d\udcda Nothing beats a brick and mortar bookstore where you can see all the pretty covers and spines and take your time perusing the shelves!

Imagine The Great British Bake Off, but then add in a little bit of a murder mystery element and you have this debut book by Jesse Maxwell!\n\nThe story follows along six home bakers as they arrive at Grafton Manor, the home of America\u2019s Grandmother, Betsy Martin, and the location of the show, Bake Week. Over the course of the next week, the contestants will be pitted against each other in a series of bakes with one person being eliminated each day until one is left and wins the coveted Golden Spoon. But off the bat, things start to wrong and a sinister undertone begins to take shape\u2026\n\nThis book is told in seven POVs\u2014 the six bakers and then Betsy herself! Though it took a tiny bit of adjusting to catch onto the narrative shifts, I did like who each character had their own distinct personality and background that it made it easier to remember each AND figure out who your favorite characters were.\n\nThroughout the course of the competition, I genuinely felt like I was watching a baking show, but in book form and I loved it! Plus it made me crave so many baked items so prepare yourself! Aside from the \u201con screen\u201d aspect, I also enjoyed the behind the scenes where you start to learn that something is going on at Grafton Manor. Certain contestants are seemingly being messed with during their bakes and you don\u2019t know why are who. But the conspiracies behind it are endless.\n\nUltimately, everything comes crashing down at the end and secrets come out for the first time in decades. Admittedly, my biggest critique of this book was with the ending because it felt very rushed when I didn\u2019t think it needed to be. (The book is only 270 pages so could\u2019ve been drawn out a bit more.) Plus I thought the reveal into the whole baking mess was so quick and underwhelming that it left some to be desired.\n\nI still very much enjoyed this and found it to be a fun mystery! It did also cover some other topics like workplace assault/ abuse, depression, and more + had a sweet found family aspect to it in the end.\n\nRating: 3.5/5\n\nThanks @atriabooks @bookclubfavorites for the gifted copy!", "total_engagement": 16, "engagement_rate": 0.0012350443844075646, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-04T20:55:55.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "grafton manor", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "contestants", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "course", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "betsy martin", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "scenes", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "location", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bakers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bit", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "the great british bake off", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "baking show", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "atriabooks"}, {"name": "bookclubfavorites"}], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9283449053764343}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039598877, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.867Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.867Z"}, {"id": 607775132039598876, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-284002090", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.865Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.865Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696031, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.038Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.676Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696033, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.041Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.682Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175203526160, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr6pMYCy1Sd/", "post_id": "3096968864127997085", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/b590d5ad8ef77c415dfcd82c2de798a9.JPEG", "phash": "ae4bc31cf5b4c449", "image_entities": [{"entity": "leaf", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23933807015419006}, {"entity": "plant", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23846417665481567}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7996689677238464}, {"entity": "clock tower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7900443077087402}, {"entity": "tableware", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6053981781005859}, {"entity": "canned packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4698008596897125}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2732808291912079}, {"entity": "bird", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2686837911605835}, {"entity": "canned packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23606474697589874}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21841320395469666}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-05-19T01:05:41.729Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:22:03.813Z"}}], "post_text": "EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY HAS KILLED SOMEONE - Book review!\n\nThis book was only of my latest #bookstagrammademedoit reads and I have so many thoughts on it!\n\nThis is a murder mystery with a fun and unique on it, mainly because of the narrative and the way it was written. Plus it plays homage and is very reminiscent of some classic detective novels by the likes of Agatha Christie and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\nThe set up was interesting, right from the get you could tell it was going to be a fun to learn about what happened on this family reunion and how each family member has each been involved with well\u2026 killing someone. \n\nThe story was broken up into different sections with each one being about a specific family member and a little more about their backstory. I thought this structure was fun and helped build quite a bit of suspense and an aura of guilt around so many people because in their own way, everybody was a little off and had their own issues they were trying to deal with. Safe to say the family drama was plentiful with this one!\n\nOne of my favorite parts about this book really was the voice of the narrator, Ernest. The premise is that he\u2019s writing a book and the story about what happened so his narration is speaking AT the reader which I found entertaining. Plus it was written in such a clever way with little easter eggs and foreshadowing. However despite that, I did find myself surprised by a few of the twists in it.\n\nI think the part I struggled with most was honestly just understanding the complexity of all the crimes, the history of the Cunningham family, and how each individual played a role in that to tie it all together. I personally found it a bit confusing to follow along the web of details to fully grasp the how and why because I think the was just so much to it. Also, when the revelation is done (in a very Poirot kind of style), while there was a lot of facts being explained it also felt like an info dumping.\n\nOverall though, I still enjoyed it for the most part. The ending and one character\u2019s fate in particular was pretty fascinating once you understood their psyche because it definitely gave me something to think about!\n\nRating: 3/5", "total_engagement": 18, "engagement_rate": 0.0013894249324585101, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-06T21:11:19.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "someone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "everyone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fun", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "family", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thoughts", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bit", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "bookstagrammademedoit"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9652227163314819}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039598899, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.943Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.943Z"}, {"id": 607775132039598898, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-205692556", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.941Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:39.941Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696039, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.058Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.703Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696040, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.062Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.709Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175203526150, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CsCp7xDvT51/", "post_id": "3099223920616488565", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/c1a7f690d6a2ca2672f539b0d48f3703.JPEG", "phash": "dac136e8077dc01f", "image_entities": [{"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7959967255592346}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.41229870915412903}, {"entity": "book cover", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3102761507034302}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9489307999610901}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.702321469783783}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5130387544631958}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.42306235432624817}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2872307002544403}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2630144953727722}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2613973915576935}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-05-19T01:05:41.264Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:21:38.831Z"}}], "post_text": "WELL, THAT WAS UNEXPECTED \u2013 Book review!\n\nMy first read of May and I had a blast with it! Think Crazy Rich Asians, but make it YA and more angsty and very sex positive and that\u2019s what you get here!\n\nThis story follows Sharlot (Jesse Q. Sutanto\u2019s jokes about name misspellings in Asian cultures will never not give me a laugh) a very typical 17 year old who gets caught in an unfortunate incident with her boyfirned. She then finds herself whisked away to Jarkarta, the place her mother grew up and left 17 years ago. We also have George Clooney, of the uber rich Tanuwijaya clan. George is involved in his own mishap which causes his father and younger sister to intervene in finding him a \u201creal\u201d girlfriend. The results? Catfishing, fake dating, real feelings, overbearing family, lots of food, drinks, and plenty of laughs.\n\nThere was so much I adored! First being how much I learned about Indo-Chinese heritage and Indonesia itself. It made me really to visit Jakarta and Bali after all the talks of the sites and delicious eats!. It was also interesting how it juxtaposed Sharlot, and American born Indo-Chinese, to those who are native to Indonesia and how their upbringings and mindsets are just so vastly different because of the cultures.\n\nSharlot herself was also an intriguing character. She came off pretty harsh at times, especially towards her mother, but I enjoyed seeing her growth as she began to understand more about her mother, her own heritage, and the reasonings behind why her mother kept so much of her past a secret from Sharlot.\n\nThis book was also just fun and hilarious! I love fake dating and seeing Sharlot and George start off on the wrong foot and grow to eventually have feelings for one another was a chaotic, but sweet journey.\n\nI also just appreciated how this YA dug into some deeper topics like slut shaming and LGBTQ+ views particularly in a conservative country. While sad and frustrating to read at times it shed light on just how different other places in the world are from what we may be familiar with.\n\nOverall, this was a lovely read and this author as absolutely an auto-buy for me now!\n\nRating: 4/5", "total_engagement": 9, "engagement_rate": 0.0006947124662292551, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-09T23:51:43.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "asians", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "read", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "indonesia", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "george clooney", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sharlot", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mother", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "blast", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039598929, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.043Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.043Z"}, {"id": 607775132039598928, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1570951434", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.040Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.040Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696044, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.082Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.735Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696045, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.087Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.742Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175203526143, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CsKGOWJyJRW/", "post_id": "3101318667536208982", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/990bb1232b24b303ca90e452ef2b3b2c.JPEG", "phash": "a9f636c9652c872c", "image_entities": [{"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9196575880050659}, {"entity": "picture frame", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.822714626789093}, {"entity": "computer monitor", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.563958466053009}, {"entity": "clock tower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.25197961926460266}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-05-19T01:05:41.089Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-13T09:21:25.384Z"}}], "post_text": "IN THE WEEDS - Book review!\n\nThis is my second BK Borison as I did read LOVELIGHT FARMS over the holidays and while I thought it was cute, I admittedly didn\u2019t LOVE like so many people have. But I did really enjoy the small town vibes and characters, so I was still super excited to read Beckett and Evie\u2019s story!\n\nLike with the last book, I adored the whole small town setting of Inglewood. It seems like such a wonderful and cozy place + I loved how tight knit everybody was in that typical small town way. I mean the gossip and phone tree is just great! Plus it was awesome seeing more Stella and Luka and then getting more of Layla and Caleb (who I know is the next book!).\n\nI also enjoyed how it didn\u2019t shy away from making Beckett\u2014 who on appearances and first take comes off as this hulking, tatted, farmer\u2014 but is really a bit vulnerable with his social anxiety and sensory issues. I enjoyed learning about his background particularly with his family. As for Evie, I appreciated her self reflection arc on stepping away from her social media livelihood to instead try and figure out what truly makes her happy. Sure, it came off as a bit cliche at times, but overall was nice.\n\nWhat I wasn\u2019t that big a fan of was parts of the romance story between Beckett and Evie itself. It started off with a weekend fling as strangers, but that weekend led to months of pining which I had a bit of hard time with because the trope has always been hit or miss for me. As the story progressed and they got reacquainted I think I just struggled to really find and understand the chemistry between the two. And while the miscommunication trope was to be expected, the one on this story just felt a little too much for my liking.\n\nAlso, while the author definitely knows how to create wonderful characters and dreamy settings, there were parts of the writing that felt a bit too repetitive.\n\nAnyway\u2026 I\u2019m still very much invested into this series and town and will eventually read Layla and Caleb\u2019s story!\n\nRating: 3.5/5\n\nThanks @berkleyromance for the digital copy!

The story follows Adelaide, an American in her mid twenties living in London. She's finishing up her masters and working when she meets Rory Hughes, her Disney Prince, and get wrapped in his enigma which leads her down a self destructing path and ultimately to an unwell mental state.\n\nSo much of Adelaide\u2019s relationship with Rory felt so relatable which is why this book hit so hard. If you\u2019ve ever been in a relation/situationship where you\u2019re putting in 110% and the other is only putting in maybe half that, you get Adelaide and Rory. If you\u2019ve ever felt yourself get so invested in someone because they\u2019re the one you\u2019ve always fantasized about, Adelaide will resonate with you. Immediately you can tell Rory is no good for Adelaide, but she\u2019s so fixated (almost obsessed) that he\u2019s The One, that she ignores all the red flags that are obvious to others.\n\nAs an outsider's perspective, it may be easy to recognize that kind of behavior, but when you\u2019re in it, it\u2019s an entirely different story. Particularly after Rory experiences a tragedy, Adelaide finds herself wanting to be supportive for Rory because she\u2019s the type who wants to help and will put others before herself. Even when Rory is unappreciative of her, she justifies his behavior and believes SHE\u2019S in the wrong.\n\nAdelaide has trauma from her past that contributes to her sense of self worth as she spirals. It\u2019s so easy to compare yourself to others, especially ex\u2019s or the future partner, of someone you dated. And that is something Adelaide continued to do until she hit a breaking point which I\u2019m sure happens a lot more in the real world than is talked about.\n\nThe mental health discussion in this book felt so honest and raw because Adelaide\u2019s story is one many will be able to relate with. Plus the story still ended on a positive/ hopeful note and I loved the support Adelaide always had when it came to her friends!\n\nRating: 5/5\n\nThank you @stmartinspress for the gifted copy!", "total_engagement": 13, "engagement_rate": 0.0010034735623311462, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-17T21:33:29.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "cover", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "expectations", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lot", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rory hughes", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "adelaide", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "stmartinspress"}], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9707032442092896}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039599021, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.390Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.390Z"}, {"id": 607775132039599019, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "697266413", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.389Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.389Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696067, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.149Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.817Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696068, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.154Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.823Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175207739628, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CsZh5eIySRM/", "post_id": "3105662502953362508", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/f70994b999cb6e6d158d3a2295216c8d.JPEG", "phash": "af1bcbf0d0d88b0c", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beverage", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.48981860280036926}, {"entity": "drink", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23816105723381042}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20766745507717133}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.930425763130188}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8154767751693726}, {"entity": "canned packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5844651460647583}, {"entity": "tap", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.29893970489501953}, {"entity": "window blind", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2179984599351883}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2143271416425705}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-05-28T01:14:49.987Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-14T23:35:22.416Z"}}], "post_text": "ALL MY RAGE - Book review!\n\nI knew this book was going to be incredible and powerful, but it still did not prepare me for just how devastatingly beautiful it would be.\n\nThis story primarily follows two teenagers of Pakistani heritage and their lives growing up in Juniper, CA. Salahudin and Noor were best friends because they were both outcasts who understood each other when nobody else could or wanted to. Eventually The Fight caused a riff, but new circumstances have caused them to be drawn towards each other again as they\u2019re each faced with unthinkable obstacles.\n\nI had such visceral reactions throughout the course of this read because of the content and comprehending the reality of the situations. Sal and Noor\u2019s stories were gripping, yet heartbreaking and it felt so raw. I had a ton of rage reading, particularly when it came to the blatant racism and abuse they constantly experienced. It\u2019s horrifying how much people love to hate and hurt on others.\n\nThis book also did a great job highlighting the immigrant experience and the work put in to live the American Dream. There are chapters from Sal\u2019s mother, Misbah, sprinkled in and you get an understanding for her past and how she carries so much hope with her. The dream and strive to keep things going is passed along to Sal who views things with a different eye, but knows he can\u2019t let his mother down so he gets caught up in things he shouldn\u2019t and even unintentionally drags Noor into it.\n\nThe events in the final third of the story created such a mixture of emotions that it felt there were no right answers to how everything would conclude. I had many conflicting feelings that left me deep in thought as it all unfolded. I can\u2019t necessarily say it was a happy ending, but it was a hopeful one that will give you a lot to think about.\n\nWhile this book is heavy with its content and social issues, it is a very important read and I would recommend it to anyone. The writing and storytelling is well done and I felt like I learned so much of Pakistani culture. This is a story that will be sticking with me for a while!\n\nRating: 5/5\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f alcoholism, addiction, sexual assault, physical abuse, racism, Islamaphobia", "total_engagement": 13,

review!\n\nThe last read for my IRL book club was this magical realism/ historical fiction! While the picnic vibes for our meeting were immaculate (we love you @traderjoes ), unfortunately the book was not quite as special as we had all hoped it would be.\n\nThe story follows Lenna Wickes as she becomes an apprentice to Vaudeline D\u2019Alliere, a spiritualist well known for being able to summon the dead and get answers and closure from them. Lenna is determined to learn about what happened to her sister Evie who died mysteriously. Then there\u2019s the London S\u00e9ance Society\u2014a male\u2019s only club that performs seances, but it seems like they are up to some trickery and also maybe some corruption\u2026\n\nStarting with the good! It was interesting to learn more about that time period in the 1800s of Victorian London because society was of course, so different than what we all know of today. Plus it was fascinating to learn more about seances and how they seemed to be much more common back in those days. We did also enjoy how it was written from two different POVs, including one in the first and one in third. The mystery surrounding Evie\u2019s death and her prior whereabouts were also was intriguing enough to keep everyone guessing on what exactly was occurring.\n\nHowever, there were aspects of the story that weren\u2019t as strong. Firstly, it felt like the plot moved fairly slow and a lot of us had a hard time really feeling engaged by the story and its characters. Also, none of the characters stood out in any way and were kind of just\u2026blah. Even though the book had some otherworldly elements, there were moments and situations where it felt like you had to suspend disbelief still.\n\nSome of the writing itself was also a bit of a miss for us because it felt like it was trying too hard and it came off as being a bit repetitive.\n\nWhile the ending was definitely very fast paced and a lot was revealed, ultimately it wasn\u2019t enough to really change anyone\u2019s mind about this book just being fine. Overall it was a book we read, enjoyed discussing, but it really wasn\u2019t that memorable. Well aside from the usage of the word \u201comnibus\u201d.\n\nGroup Rating: 3/5", "total_engagement": 14, "engagement_rate": 0.001080663836356619, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-23T22:14:17.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "answers", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lenna wickes", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "irl", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "club", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "london", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "realism", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "meeting", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "writing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "evie", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "traderjoes"}], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9518505930900574}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039599136, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.773Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.773Z"}, {"id": 607775132039599134, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1672581481", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.771Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.771Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696093, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.235Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.945Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696094, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.242Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.952Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175215244332, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CswgfICPtmv/", "post_id": "3112130218932754863", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/bfa8bf521b89a721ba4ae33edd9d80f5.JPEG", "phash": "87c1fc5d6db240b1", "image_entities": [{"entity": "alcohol", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9179027676582336}, {"entity": "beverage", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.38808050751686096}, {"entity": "drink", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2600809633731842}, {"entity": "food", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2189994901418686}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8093429803848267}, {"entity": "tableware", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6516575813293457}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-06-07T01:21:27.522Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T05:33:10.269Z"}}], "post_text": "ROMANTIC COMEDY - Book review!\n\nThis was my very first Curtis Sittenfeld book, and I\u2019m sad I didn\u2019t love it more. I\u2019m not sure if it was just this book or the author, but here are some thoughts on of the most buzz worthy books of late!\n\nThe story follows a comedy sketch writer, Sally, and the workings of the live late night comedy show she works on which is basically SNL. During the week Noah Brewster, a famous pop singer, hosts Sally finds her and Noah instantly connecting in a way she didn\u2019t think possible. Because Sally has been around enough to see how several ordinary guys on the show seem to hit it off and find love with glamorous women. But she knows that could never happen if the roles were reversed.\n\nThe book is split into three chapters. Yes, three. The first I did find interesting to start because it dove deep into the inner workings of a show like SNL. It walked you through what an average week looked like for a sketch writer, the late nights, and all the work put in. While I enjoyed this at first, it became monotonous when it was 100 pages long. Also in this section, you see the first bits of Sally and Noah\u2019s relationship and honestly? I never felt it. Plus I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of Sally\u2019s constant \u201cwoe is me\u201d attitude.\n\nThe next chapter is a hundreds pages with of email exchanges between Sally and Noah during the pandemic lockdown. Here, you see them begin to open up a bit more with each other which was nice. While I enjoyed this section better, I still struggled to connect with them and the story.\n\nThe last chapter is when Sally decides to spend quarantine with Noah and their relationship takes the next steps because they actually get to do things in person and private! I still never felt invested into them and Sally was still so hell bent about the whole \u201ca guy like him would never be into someone like me\u201d that it became so grating.\n\nI do typically enjoy a good celebrity romance story, but aybe it was the drawn out chapters, or just the writing, I\u2019m not sure. One day I\u2019ll give the author another try, but unfortunately this one wasn\u2019t for me even though it\u2019s been loved by so many others!\n\nRating: 2.5/5", "total_engagement": 10, "engagement_rate": 0.0007719027402547279, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-27T19:14:14.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "noah brewster", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "author", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "curtis sittenfeld", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "books", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "comedy", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thoughts", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "romantic comedy", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "show", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039599183, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.876Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.876Z"}, {"id": 607775132039599180, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-759325959", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.874Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:40.874Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696099, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.263Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.973Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696100, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.267Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:43.979Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175215244330, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs4g1NiyIjK/", "post_id": "3114383536489531594", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/4567fa9d8ebf90a468fd6f8c1174fb29.JPEG", "phash": "9ce660cd327b46d8", "image_entities": [{"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9889907836914062}, {"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9436384439468384}, {"entity": "cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.44102826714515686}, {"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3647533655166626}, {"entity": "morning", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2159528285264969}, {"entity": "pottery", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21011866629123688}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7391966581344604}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6973357200622559}, {"entity": "tableware", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6558896899223328}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6437492370605469}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4694792330265045}, {"entity": "tableware", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3997541069984436}, {"entity": "flower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3492317795753479}, {"entity": "flower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2402057945728302}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.210792675614357}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-06-07T01:21:27.267Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T05:32:53.924Z"}}], "post_text": "MINI REVIEWS!\n\nI have a few books I\u2019ve read recently-ish where I didn\u2019t have the brain capacity to write a full review. So instead, here are a few thoughts on these four books!\n\nWHAT THE NEIGHBORS SAW: A fresh voice in the thriller! Elite DC neighborhood with some real housewife vibes and a murder\u2026 super quick read and very bingeworthy. Enjoyed the commentary on class, race, etc. and was entranced by the lives of the elite and those who aspired to be elite. A little underwhelming end and also took a turn I wasn\u2019t expecting and am still unsure of how I liked the twist.\nRating: 3.5/5 (out 6/20, thank you @minotaur_books !)\n\nMY MECHANICAL ROMANCE: Such a fun and cute YA romance focusing on STEM, specifically women in STEM! Learned more than expected (and was fascinated) by robotics. Appreciated the conversations of the struggles young women face stepping into this field. Some of the science-y talk went over my head, but it was fine! Wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the MMC, but still enjoyed overall.\nRating: 3.5/5\n\nHOLDING PATTERN: Loved the immigration and Chinese culture rep. Very interesting albeit a bit weird of a premise, but had heart and discussed the intricacies of mother-daughter relationships. Some quirky characters and situations and at times I didn\u2019t feel connected to the story. Overall though, a short read with some thoughtful themes.\nRating: 3/5 (out 6/20, thank you @riverheadbooks !)\n\nTHE GIRLS OF SUMMER: The Greek island setting was dreamy! The rest of the book was not quite for me. Yes it\u2019s a thriller and had some disturbing topics brought up, but written in a way that I wasn\u2019t a fan of. I know I should\u2019ve felt sympathy for the MC, but I struggled to because there wasn\u2019t enough character development or explanation to why she behaved the way she did. Very quick read that held my attention enough, although was also fairly predictable.\nRating: 2.5/5 (out 6/6, thank you @stmartinspress !)\n\nOff to finish up what will likely be my last read of May

chilling thriller that involves a serial killer, named Aidan and the three women in his life who are currently closest to him. There\u2019s the woman (Rachel) who he kidnapped five years ago and instead of killing her, has kept her alive in a shed since. Now, sudden life changes have caused him to move her into his home where she now has (limited) access to another human: his 13 year old daughter, Cecilia. Then there\u2019s the third, Emily, who works at the local restaurant and has her eyes on Aidan.\n\nThis book was addicting from the beginning! Told in alternating perspectives of the three, it did a great job of keeping me engaged and also wondering what was going to happen. Rachel\u2019s narrative was the most interesting because of her harrowing story and the way Aidan has asserted his dominance and control over her during the five year span she\u2019s been his victim. While infuriating to see how she was treated and victimized, her storyline also showed a lot of resiliency during her fight for survival.\n\nIt was also fascinating to see Aidan and Rachel play the part of domesticated roommates in front of Cecilia, but then learn what actually goes on behind the scenes.\n\nI did have a few issues though, most of it having to do with the ending because ultimately I did find it to be fairly unsatisfying because a lot of the questions I had were not answered. They \"why\" of everything was never explained and I wish we had learned more about Aidan\u2019s psyche to commit his crimes. There were a few super short chapters thrown in that were not from one of the three main POVs that were so interesting and I wish that angle had been explored more. I also thought there would be more drama or expanded relationships between Rachel, Emily, and Cecilia towards the end, but that also didn\u2019t quite happen in a way I would have hoped

Book review!\n\nSo I knew heading into this read that it was going to be a dark one, but even that forewarning did not adequately prepare me for how truly dark it was!\n\nThe first chapter of the book takes place at a trial where we learn a witness has been asked to testify at a rape trial. This witness makes a choice on the stand and then we are thrown back to two years prior where this whole saga begins.\n\nOur MC, Jonah, is a struggling writer with a harsh upbringing and religious parents that put Jonah through conversion therapy because of the belief that would rid him of his homosexuality. The book is definitely tough at times, but that whole background is what helped shape Jonah into the man he is in the current day and how he makes his decisions. Soon, Jonah gets wrapped into the luxurious high life of a wealthy playwright, Richard, and his companions, but soon realizes everything isn\u2019t as perfect as he hoped.\n\nThis is where the book gets dark as it begins to describe the toxicity of the relationship between Jonah and Richard, along with Richard\u2019s other affluent friends and more vulnerable young men. It depict the imbalance and struggle between those with power and those who can be preyed upon.\n\nThere were several instances where my blood boiled because of the actions of these powerful men and the injustices occurring throughout, but I think that\u2019s what made this book so good.\n\nOverall, highly recommend if you\u2019re into dark and disturbing thrillers!\n\nRating: 4/5", "total_engagement": 9, "engagement_rate": 0.0006947124662292551, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-12T23:02:29.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "richard", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "place", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "read", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "belief", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "chapter", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "witness", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "jonah", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "trial", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.950592041015625}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039599573, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.285Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.285Z"}, {"id": 607775132039599567, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-992853680", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.282Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.282Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696139, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.376Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.116Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696140, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.379Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.124Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175218445260, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CtfJyOpyeDV/", "post_id": "3125259700544331989", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/375ad740722bc5ce2b6b3493933cb405.JPEG", "phash": "9085e718963de0fb", "image_entities": [{"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9936093091964722}, {"entity": "bookcase", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9605433940887451}, {"entity": "furniture", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8914629817008972}, {"entity": "library", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5459468364715576}, {"entity": "publication", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.26558104157447815}, {"entity": "shelving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23306386172771454}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22241227328777313}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.889367938041687}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5603342056274414}, {"entity": "box", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.43047958612442017}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4210987985134125}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20260269939899445}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-06-17T01:29:01.529Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T05:33:36.605Z"}}], "post_text": "THE DAYDREAMS - Book review!\n\nIf you\u2019re a fun of reunions, TV drama, celebrity romance, and just want to feel a little nostalgic, then check out Laura Hankin\u2019s recent release!\n\nThis is about a popular teen show called The Daydreams. The cast was made up of four seemingly innocent teens who became close during their two seasons. But during their second season live finale, everything blew up and nobody spoke to each other again. Fast forward 13 years, they each have carried on with their lives in their own ways and have tried to put the show in the past. Now with the demands of a reunion special, they are forced back together to try and create some more magic, but old secrets may be revealed and it may just be a big disaster\u2026\n\nThis book is told in two timelines, both primarily from the POV of Kat\u2014 the evil one on the show. While this book was entertaining and read quickly, it did feel more character driven than plot at times. I really enjoyed the dynamics between all the characters from both the past and how it evolved to present. Since they were just teenagers, it was messy and complicated, but also juicy because you kept wanting to know what happened during that finale!\n\nI also really appreciated some of the other topics brought up such as misogyny in the workplace, specifically in the entertainment industry, by highlighting the bad behavior by show runners and other individuals in power. (I happened to read this on the heels of I\u2019M GLAD MY MOM DIED and it paired perfectly.) It also brought up the issue of paparazzi/ tabloids and how a celebrity's every move is critiqued and one minor thing can be taken out of context and ruin perception.\n\nWhile I enjoyed most things, I did wish for a bit more character development because there were times I felt like I struggled to connect with anybody or truly understand their behavior and actions.There was also the romance subplot that I just didn't feel invested in, maybe because of the characters itself.\n\nThis book has been likened too Daisy Jones and I can see how, but I do think this is its own unique story and if you enjoy this kind of thing, it could be for you!\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThanks @berkleypub for the gifted copy!", "total_engagement": 4, "engagement_rate": 0.00030876109610189115, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-14T22:00:10.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "romance", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "each other", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "finale", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teens", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "cast", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reunions", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tv", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "show", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "celebrity", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nobody", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "drama", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fun", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "berkleypub"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039599669, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.499Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.499Z"}, {"id": 607775132039599667, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1676785728", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.496Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.496Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696144, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.397Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.146Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696147, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.401Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.158Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175225268812, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CtkI7N9y-ZA/", "post_id": "3126663295118599744", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/a3750fa6f1d080deff0ebed03706eb95.JPEG", "phash": "b91c97dade639021", "image_entities": [{"entity": "leaf", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.47539106011390686}, {"entity": "plant", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30186399817466736}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9625093936920166}, {"entity": "canned packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8481737375259399}, {"entity": "computer monitor", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.816322386264801}, {"entity": "picture frame", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7548555731773376}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.38523003458976746}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-07-15T17:59:21.537Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T15:31:12.142Z"}}], "post_text": "LOVE, THEORETICALLY \u2013 Book review!\n\nMy third Ali Hazelwood book and I don't know how to feel anymore.\n\nYou hear about how her books follow the same formula and you want to believe it's not true... but it is. Big man/ tiny woman, enemies to lovers, the guy falls first, an evil enemy ready to take down the FMC because misogyny in STEM. I genuinely loved it the first time around in TLH, but at this point it\u2019s just become predictable and repetitive.\n\nFor this book, I of course still really appreciate the women in STEM themes and how Hazelwood doesn\u2019t shy away from shedding some ugly truths on what this field, primarily dominated by men, can be like. I also liked who our FMC in this story, Elsie, suffered from chronic illness (type 1 diabetes) and the struggles of that while not have adequate healthcare felt relatable.\n\nThis book does also have more of an academia/ politics within it feel which made it a tad different than some of her previous stories. I did also like a few of the side characters, such as George, and hope we can somehow see more of her someday.\n\nAside from the aforementioned grievances, another thing I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of in this book was Elsie herself. She is and always has been a people pleaser which is something I totally understand, but there were parts about this that just felt off. It\u2019s hard to explain, but\u00a0part of it was how Jack came in, told her to say \u201chonesty\u201d and BAM it was like there was never an issue. Sure it can be seen as sweet, but I just had a hard time with her character.\n\nAlso, her obsession with cheese and Twilight was fun at first, but then I felt like it became a thing to constantly mention this and it became way too much.\n\nWhile there were some qualities that made this book a little different, ultimately I found it too similar in structure and plot where I\u2019m really wondering if AH can write anything else because I am tired of hearing the many adjectives to describe the big MMC. Like can we get something a little different?\n\nDespite this, I can see myself still reading her books in the hopes of getting something new, but we shall see!\n\nRating: 2.5/5\n\nThanks @berkleyromance for the digital copy, out now.", "total_engagement": 17, "engagement_rate": 0.0013122346584330375, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-16T20:28:51.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "time", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "man", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "formula", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "guy", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lovers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "books", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "elsie", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ali hazelwood", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "enemy", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "berkleyromance"}], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9296881556510925}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039599701, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.571Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.571Z"}, {"id": 607775132039599700, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1345791835", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.569Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.569Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696152, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.421Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.197Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696155, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.427Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.204Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175225268799, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CtujcrbPhkb/", "post_id": "3129594693470263579", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/d0ad33232a7783c283efd77d99ff8909.JPEG", "phash": "e2bdc382fc4299a6", "image_entities": [{"entity": "product", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2577759027481079}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8846585154533386}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7679556608200073}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6337715983390808}, {"entity": "tableware", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5368043780326843}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4193417429924011}, {"entity": "canned packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2637495696544647}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20978136360645294}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-07-15T18:01:35.551Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T15:30:25.753Z"}}], "post_text": "HEARTSTOPPER SERIES \ud83d\udc96\n\nI read these earlier this year and it was my first time diving into the world of graphic novels, and oh my goodness this series just made my heart burst with so much happiness!\n\nI don\u2019t think I have the proper words to adequately sum up how much I adored Charlie and Nick and the entire series. First we see their friendship grow into something more and it was particularly heartwarming seeing how sweet Nick was despite his internal confusion with his own sexuality. Their story also depicted the ugly side of things such as bullying, stereotypes, etc. and was so honest and genuine that it was easy to connect and root for the characters.\n\nI also wasn\u2019t prepared to get so emotional based off the sketches themselves, but Alice Oseman did a wonderful job of bringing the scenes to life that it made everything that much more special.\n\nThere\u2019s not much else to say other than read this series if you haven\u2019t already. You will fly through each novel and hopefully love Charlie and Nick as much as I did.\n\nNow I need to go watch the Netflix series!", "total_engagement": 14, "engagement_rate": 0.001080663836356619, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-20T21:33:01.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "time", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "heart", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "friendship", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "series", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "series", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "everything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "world", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nick", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "words", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goodness", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "heartstopper", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "charlie", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "graphic novels", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9516812562942505}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039599743, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.683Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.683Z"}, {"id": 607775132039599742, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1645245542", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.682Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.682Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696160, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.446Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.222Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696161, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.450Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.229Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175225268823, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Ctzy4brydkn/", "post_id": "3131069946294556967", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/e33b4abfb465d18483c83c3ce0dee40c.JPEG", "phash": "ffa57a15234c86c8", "image_entities": [{"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.970058262348175}, {"entity": "bookcase", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9601351022720337}, {"entity": "bookselling", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9171362519264221}, {"entity": "furniture", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8781594634056091}, {"entity": "library", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7903851270675659}, {"entity": "publication", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7850854396820068}, {"entity": "shelf", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6869009733200073}, {"entity": "shelving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5536885261535645}, {"entity": "bookstore", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24434596300125122}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.95502769947052}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.622245728969574}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5180022716522217}, {"entity": "computer monitor", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5167231559753418}, {"entity": "bracelet", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5015298128128052}, {"entity": "watch", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2502650320529938}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-07-15T17:51:11.541Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T15:31:27.473Z"}}], "post_text": "THE FOREBODING - Book review!\n\nI was lucky enough to receive a copy of this debut (hand delivered from Colorado, by the author itself!) and loved how original it was!\n\nThe best way I could think to describe this would be: Blake Crouch + The Shadows by Alex North. This is a speculative fiction/ sci-fi thriller that broaches themes like control, manipulation, good vs. evil, and more while also discussing the strengths and power of the human mind and how remarkable, yet scary it can be.\n\nOne thing I immediately loved was how atmospheric it was. There were moments where I genuinely felt like I was there with our MC, Shiloh, while she experienced strange happenings around her. It was eerie and unsettling at times, but that\u2019s what made it so intriguing. While it did take a few chapters to set the scene and get into the thick of it all, once a certain point hit it was hard to put down.\n\nSome of the sci-fi elements that appeared were the ideas of psychokinesis & psychomanipulation\u2014 two concepts that while aren\u2019t actually a thing (yet...), but made for some insightful commentary and thought. For example, what if you could will your mind to do cool things like move a book? Or on the darker side, what if people had the ability to access someone else\u2019s subconscious and used this manipulation for their own good?\n\nThe plot itself was interesting as we followed Shiloh and her introduction to the world of psychokinesis and the realization that she herself is in the center of a lot of it. I enjoyed the other characters and the found family element there as this group of people worked together to stop the evil force of someone who seems to have gone rogue with their own agenda.\n\nAs for the science-y aspect of the writing, for the most part I found it easy to follow. Science was never a strong subject for myself, so it\u2019s not unusual for some of the language in a sci-fi to go over my head, but I think the author did a nice job of making this story feel accessible for anyone to understand.\n\nOverall it was an impressive debut and I would recommend if you like speculative thrillers and thought provoking reads!\n\nRating: 4.5/5\n\nOfficially releases

You can imagine it made for an infuriating, but informative read.\n\nThe book is split into two halves. The first is from the POV of Rosie\u2014 a 17 year old with synesthesia. Rosie grew up on the Rosseau Vineyard in Sonoma, CA and remains there in ward of the vineyards\u2019 owners, Celine and Truman until sent to what she believes is a home for unwed mothers.\n\nThe second half is from the POV of Truman's sister, Helen. She spent the last 40ish years in Europe as a nanny. During the war she witnessed unspeakable things that changed her. When Rosie was a child, Helen forged a friendship with her, so when Helen returns to California in 1947, she is determined to find out what happened to Rosie.\n\nBoth Rosie and Helen\u2019s story was so heartbreaking because it really showed how cruel and mistreated people with disabilities were during that time. Rosie\u2019s synesthesia as well as the deformities of a child Helen nannied for were both seen as a handicap and burden to society by their respective governments. And to make matters worse, these institutions took away people\u2019s rights and made life altering decisions for them because they \u201cknew better\u201d and were \u201ctrying to only create perfect people\u201d.\n\nI just couldn\u2019t believe the backwards thinking that took place in a time that really wasn\u2019t that long ago. AND to learn that the ideologies that led to these atrocities occurring in America (and largely in California) are pretty similar to that of Nazi Germany was so eye opening.\n\nThe ending was also super powerful and as hopeful as you can be in a story with so many appalling events. The book also felt timely too because of the discussions it brought up around reproductive rights. And even as the author note stated, the eugenics movement may be in the past, but sadly the ideologies remain. And because of that, I found this book to be so so important and would highly recommend!\n\nRating: 5/5", "total_engagement": 9, "engagement_rate": 0.0006947124662292551, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-28T22:59:57.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "wwii", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "susan meissner", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rosie", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "helen", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nazi germany", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039599868, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.944Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.944Z"}, {"id": 607775132039599866, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "275802836", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.943Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:42.943Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696197, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.520Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.315Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696199, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.527Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.321Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175225268803, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CuIVRRWyyD9/", "post_id": "3136850686307410173", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/aaade622eb1c1475e83435bc95d0e69f.JPEG", "phash": "e807a659a8a0dadf", "image_entities": [{"entity": "alcohol", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5784154534339905}, {"entity": "bottle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5589427947998047}, {"entity": "drink", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2766164243221283}, {"entity": "liqueur", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21454188227653503}, {"entity": "product", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20837105810642242}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.927826464176178}, {"entity": "picture frame", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7708978056907654}, {"entity": "flower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.626658022403717}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5623292922973633}, {"entity": "canned packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.41038206219673157}, {"entity": "knife", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.25022050738334656}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23829035460948944}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-07-15T18:00:41.407Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T15:30:41.868Z"}}], "post_text": "THE SEVEN YEAR SLIP - Book review!\n\nAshley Poston has done it again! Like with her debut, THE DEAD ROMANTICS, I went into this book without a whole lot of background or expectations and I came out totally loving it! This sophomore book was utterly sweet and full of heart and character.\n\nClementine is struggling with the recent loss of her Aunt\u2014 the woman who very much acted like a mother figure and was her globetrotting partner ever since she was young. She\u2019s been at the same overworked publishing job for the last seven years and overall is just sort of going through the motions of life. Clementine has also inherited her aunt\u2019s apartment\u2014 a place that supposedly has a little magic to it. One day after entering, Clementine meets a man, Iwan, in the apartment and realizes that she has slipped back in time to seven years ago. What comes next is a story of timing and love and chances.\n\nI\u2019m a sucker for books with time travel, so go figure I really enjoyed the premise of this story! It felt original in its own way and I loved how the author structured these slips in time. Because even though technically, Clementine is meeting Iwan seven years in the past, it still felt like the present in some ways.\n\nWhile parts of the romance plot felt fairly predictable, I still enjoyed following along and seeing how everything played out. I particularly loved the themes it brought up of chasing your dreams (or in the case of this story, the moon) and how those dreams and the person itself can change over time. It makes you want to reflect on self-growth and taking chances.\n\nThis was an overall clever and witty story with some scenes that will make your mouth water because of the delicious foods. It had its tender moments that were very heartwarming and I just loved its approach to the different relationships between the various characters. \n\nRating: 4/5", "total_engagement": 10, "engagement_rate": 0.0007719027402547279, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-30T21:49:23.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "background", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "expectations", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lot", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "debut", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sucker", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sophomore book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9524147510528564}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039599916, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.042Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.042Z"}, {"id": 607775132039599913, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1494676681", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.040Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.040Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696204, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.551Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.342Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696206, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.554Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.347Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175225268795, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CuXnve3SOVY/", "post_id": "3141154051883328856", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/5382d8694d9d2eef5ccb90dce0f1f69d.JPEG", "phash": "f56263e5e4ba1a0a", "image_entities": [{"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.29126617312431335}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7535489797592163}, {"entity": "clock tower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6932826042175293}, {"entity": "clock", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5376648902893066}, {"entity": "flowerpot", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.49184179306030273}, {"entity": "pen", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4755871593952179}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3628930449485779}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-07-15T18:07:20.055Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T15:30:02.589Z"}}], "post_text": "JUNE READING WRAP UP \ud83c\udf49\u2600\ufe0f\n\nI may be a few days late, but I finished up my June bujo!

Business has been slow, she doesn\u2019t have the closest relationship with her only son, Tilly (her motherly nagging seems to bother Tilly), and has a lonely routine she seems to stick to each day. However, things suddenly change once a body is discovered in her shop and she takes it upon herself to deduce what happened since the police aren\u2019t taking the investigation seriously. What transpires are new friends, sneaky suspicions, a whole lot of laughs, and delicious food.\n\nThe most common words used to describe this book by the group would probably be adorable and heartwarming. Firstly, Vera is a force to be reckoned with, but such a great character. She embodied big grandma energy and was just a hoot! Some of us found ourselves doing things in our regular lives and wondering \u201cwhat would Vera say if she knew I was doing this?\u201d.\n\nAs for the mystery itself, it was done well enough to where it did have people guessing and wondering who committed the crime and how it was all going to play out. Although, some wished there for a bit more suspense throughout the entire story instead of just revealing a bulk of it towards the end. While mystery and detective work done by Vera was fun to follow along, like with a lot of cozy mysteries, it definitely had its far fetched moments and you have to suspend disbelief. But when you learned who the killer was, it all made so much sense!\n\nOne thing though that everyone loved about this book was the found family aspect. What was once a bunch of strangers at the story of this adventures turned into such a wonderful group of people\u2014 even when a handful may have been suspects. It was especially sweet seeing Vera have these people to dote on because she genuinely seemed like such a great and caring person, constantly spoiling everyone with delicious food!\n\nOverall, this was an enjoyable read and if cozy mysteries are your thing, you\u2019ll probably like this one!\n\nGroup rating: 3.75/5", "total_engagement": 14, "engagement_rate": 0.001080663836356619, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-07-07T22:04:58.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "murderers", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mystery", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "vera wong", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tea", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tilly", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039600003, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.231Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.231Z"}, {"id": 607775132039600001, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "880918356", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.229Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.229Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696223, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.592Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.396Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696225, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.596Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.402Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175225268842, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CuiMmjCvawt/", "post_id": "3144130915383225389", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/2a6d3b125ceaf51dd5fc90263863bbc1.JPEG", "phash": "aacbe7345b689309", "image_entities": [{"entity": "eyewear", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3682345449924469}, {"entity": "pink", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3393559753894806}, {"entity": "sunglasses", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9921103119850159}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6060387492179871}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5929563641548157}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5886102318763733}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5856192111968994}, {"entity": "pen", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.49466124176979065}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.46778517961502075}, {"entity": "baseball cap", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.39326852560043335}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2960720360279083}, {"entity": "canned packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2580426037311554}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-07-15T18:01:45.584Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T15:32:09.031Z"}}], "post_text": "COOL FOR THE SUMMER & GOING BICOASTAL - Mini reviews!\n\nI have been really loving some YAs lately this summer and these two books by Dahlia Adler really encapsulated everything about why I adore this genre!\n\nCOOL FOR THE SUMMER: Such a fun coming of age/ identity story!

One is of Natalya staying in New York with her father where she finally has the courage to talk to \u201cthe red head\u201d aka Elly and start something new in the city. Then there\u2019s the story of where Natalya instead chooses to head west to LA to spend the summer with her mother and work as an intern where she falls for the other intern, Adam, and finds a passion for other things. This book totally felt like a fun choose your own adventure type of story and both Elly and Adam were such great, yet different love interests and it was easy to root for both of their stories. I also loved how this wasn\u2019t a love triangle and the ending will make you smile no matter what. It was another fast and addicting read that screamed summer! Rating: 4/5\n\nIf you have not read a Dahlia Adler book yet, I would recommend you do! Her stories are just so fun and well written and also have excellent Jewish rep and queer themes.\n\nThanks so much @wednesdaybooks for both of these gifted copies!", "total_engagement": 11, "engagement_rate": 0.0008490930142802007, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-07-10T22:53:54.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "coming of age", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "everything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "dahlia adler", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "read", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "stories", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "cool for the summer & going bicoastal", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "natalya", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "kind", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fun", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "books", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "journey", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "wednesdaybooks"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039600050, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.375Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.375Z"}, {"id": 607775132039600049, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "347406139", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.374Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.374Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696229, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.610Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.424Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696231, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.615Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.430Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175230163471, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CupwuujylsP/", "post_id": "3146260132016053007", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/74a97102c4eeafbf7790936efee06bf1.JPEG", "phash": "e25ba2b89bc696c4", "image_entities": [{"entity": "animal", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8232017159461975}, {"entity": "canidae", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.606816828250885}, {"entity": "canine", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5554514527320862}, {"entity": "carnivore", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.555064857006073}, {"entity": "dog breed", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4255693256855011}, {"entity": "dog", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.35519248247146606}, {"entity": "mammal", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3209690749645233}, {"entity": "pet", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.32033994793891907}, {"entity": "german shepherd dog", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30492570996284485}, {"entity": "puppy", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.27104994654655457}, {"entity": "dog", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9338216781616211}, {"entity": "pig", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6279343962669373}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6177040338516235}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5522686839103699}, {"entity": "canned packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3208191394805908}, {"entity": "sheep", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.31107258796691895}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-07-28T00:27:31.742Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T15:33:16.115Z"}}], "post_text": "STRANGE SALLY DIAMOND \u2013 Book review!\n\nIf you're looking for a dark, compelling read this summer be sure to add this to your list!\n\nThis tells the story of Sally Diamond and her extremely unconventional and dark upbringing. After her father dies, Sally finds herself and her story propelled into the spotlight for reasons she was unaware of until now. What unfolds is the truth behind her shocking and vile past.\n\nThis story is told from two POVs. First, we get Sally herself who is in her 40s and seen as \u201cquirky\u201d. She might come off as neurodiverse, and while that may be part of the case, her social development was extremely different than that of typical individuals. And that\u2019s mostly due to the childhood she has no recollection of. Then we get the narrative in the past from a boy named Peter who\u2019s story was equally fascinating in its own twisted, psychological way. Told in alternating views, this book became so propulsive it was hard to put down even during the tough parts.\n\nSally comes off as naive, too literal, and awkward and while this may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea (think Nina from THE MAID), I really enjoyed her character\u2019s growth and she was someone who was so easy to root for even through all the bad. Plus I appreciated how she wasn\u2019t just quirky for the sake of it, but instead it was to show how a traumatic childhood could play a pivotal role in development. I loved seeing her learn social skills and have relationships with new friends and other family members. And even though she experienced lots of challenges, seeing her struggles made so much sense.\n\nNow, Peter's character almost acted as a contrast to Sally\u2019s which I found cleverly done because it made you think about how two people who both experienced trauma at a young and vulnerable age can grow up with completely different mindsets.\n\nWhile the ending was a tiny bit underwhelming, I still flew through this one and think it was a super interesting read with some truly messed up family drama and dynamics. I cannot emphasize enough how dark it is, please check TWs!\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThanks @bookclubfavorites for the gifted copy!

After Sadie\u2019s live is saved by a Good Samaritan, it is discovered that she needs (minor?) brain surgery to correct an issue. The surgery goes smoothly, but one of the results is that Sadie is temporarily suffers from prosopagnosia otherwise known as face blindness. Sadie is forced to adjust to this in the interim, but it\u2019s not an easy task especially when she has other artistic goals and a couple of potential love interests\u2026\n\nThere were so many reasons I enjoyed this, one of the main ones being the discussions it had surrounding facial recognition and the senses. It\u2019s one of the those things we take fore granted, you don\u2019t realize how critical that function is. It was fascinating to read more about the intricacies and how incredible  the human brain is that one misfiring can change so much. This book discussed confirmation bias and how we do it even if we don\u2019t mean to, but that it can completely affect perception.\n\nAs for the romance, it felt slightly like a slow burn at the beginning only because it took longer than expected to get to our love interests. But once we got introduced, it was fun because Sadie\u2019s inner voice was so fantastical and entertaining as she dreamt up different scenarios for each guy. Yes the romance piece was predictable, but I was still compelling because you\u2019re left to figure out how everything ties in and is related to each other.\n\nAnother thing I liked about the story was how it addressed the miscommunication struggle in a realistic way since a lot people don\u2019t tend to like this.\n\nAside from overcoming her face blindness, Sadie also learns how to stand up for herself when it comes to her family. Her father remarried shortly after her mother\u2019s death, giving Sadie a stepmother and an EVIL stepsister. But in the end, it was nice to see her character growth and arc and how she used her mother\u2019s influence into creating her own persona.\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThanks @stmartinspress for the gifted copy!", "total_engagement": 6, "engagement_rate": 0.00046314164415283673, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-07-19T23:10:04.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "katherine center", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "heart", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hello stranger", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "surgery", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "father", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sadie", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mother", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "stmartinspress"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039600173, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.678Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.678Z"}, {"id": 607775132039600172, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-278843218", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.677Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:30:43.677Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696253, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.677Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.536Z"}, {"id": 607775132175696254, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:45:46.683Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.569Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175230163416, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cu75tHVvJlx/", "post_id": "3151366153184254321", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/9393a3c8b9e673559e9ff29cd5b43940.JPEG", "phash": "beb9e9c6924a9113", "image_entities": [{"entity": "drink", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.46478429436683655}, {"entity": "picture frame", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9458851218223572}, {"entity": "computer monitor", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8385405540466309}, {"entity": "spoon", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7603754997253418}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7506780028343201}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6481696367263794}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.584332287311554}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.35692542791366577}, {"entity": "soccer ball", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3464728891849518}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3289435803890228}, {"entity": "tableware", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3266598880290985}, {"entity": "pen", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22837936878204346}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-07-28T00:35:19.878Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T15:32:35.710Z"}}], "post_text": "If you\u2019re on the hunt for a couple of solid summer mysteries/ thrillers, then I have two for you!\n\nTHE BLOCK PARTY: This book totally gave off some BIG LITTLE LIES x THE REAL HOUSEWIVES vibes and it was just pure entertainment from start to finish! There\u2019s the wealthy/ prestigious neighborhood and its residents where they give off the impression everything is peachy when the reality is there are so many secrets. I loved how the story was told from two POVs\u2014 one from Alex, a mother in the neighborhood, and the second from her daughter, Lettie. There was so much drama when it came to both the adults and the teenagers so it was interesting to capture it from these two\u2019s view. This book also had me guessing almost the entire time. You know from the start that someone has been killed at the annual block party in present time, but you don\u2019t understand why without knowing what happened in the year leading up to it. And in that timeframe, there were SO many possible victims and suspects that I honestly didn\u2019t have it figured out until right up to the moment it happened! Rating: 4/5\n\nYOU CAN TRUST ME: I always enjoy a good con artist story and this one was quite entertaining and thrilling! I loved following both Summer and Leo and learning about their backstories that led them into the art of conning in the first place + they were both easy to root for. As for the central plot, it felt like a cat and mouse game between Summer and the uber rich business man/ philanthropist, Michael Forrester. The setting of the private island was fun and created a sense of mystery and I found myself curious as to where things were headed. While there were some surprises and twists, I also felt that some parts were predictable. Fortunately, that didn\u2019t make anything less fascinating and I was hooked almost the entirety of the story. And the ending was filled with action! The conclusion leaves off a bit ambiguously and I still had some questions, yet it seems like there could be a follow up, but was satisfying enough. Appreciated the themes of class, vengeance, and sisterhood/ family! Rating: 4/5\n\nThanks @stmartinspress for the gifted copy of THE BLOCK PARTY!

One of them is unaware they are speaking to their rival while the other does making for even more fun. Eventually the two find themselves reporting in the midst of a war between an awakened God who is seeking vengeance on a Goddess who ruined his life hundreds of years ago.\n\nWhile on first glance and impression, this book gives off fantasy vibes, in all honesty, it didn\u2019t quite feel that way. The world building was extremely simplistic (in a good way) and instead this story felt like a war era historical fiction with some magical realism elements taking place in a not too complicated world. And\u2026 I loved this blend of genres.\n\nI found myself engaged throughout the story and wanting to know what was going to happen. There were moments that felt so intense that it was difficult to tear my attention from the page because I just needed to see how everything would end.\n\nI also really liked the small bits of found family aspect and how people supported others in times of need. It also showed how some people are just genuinely GOOD humans who will go out of their way to help others even in the most dire of times.\n\nAs for the romance piece, I do enjoy a good enemies to lovers story and I really loved the inclusion of an epistolary format with the letters. Plus the communication between the two was so sweet and pure it became easy to root for them. And of course a little tension never hurt anybody! I do admit thought that there were a few things about the romance that came off a bit YA-ish for my liking, but overall was still nice.\n\nThe writing was another thing that was great with this story. It was beautifully written it was easy to get lost in this world and feel invested in all the happenings. The ending was also exciting and made the anticipation for the second book in this duology skyrocket!\n\nRating: 4.5/5\n\nThanks @wednesdaybooks for the gifted copy!", "total_engagement": 182,

Book review!\n\nOkay Lisa Jewell fans, buckle up because her latest is entertaining and a wild ride and I think it just might be her best yet!\n\nThis story follows the lives of two women who happen to live in the same town and cross paths on their shared birthday. The two are total opposites:\u2014 Josie and her life come off a bit strange, but that just could be due to her upbringing and the horrible events from her teenaged years that have led her to the present. Then there\u2019s Alix, a podcaster with a caring (albeit unpredictable) husband, wonderful children, and the perfect home. The two forge an odd relationship of sorts when Josie asks Alix to interview her for her podcast to tell her story. Though there\u2019s something unsettling about it all, Alix can\u2019t help but be intrigued and carry on with the project, only inviting Josie closer into her life\u2026\n\nThere is a ton to unpack with this story! Of course the plot itself was fascinating, although at times a bit dark. That didn\u2019t stop me from reading and I found the pacing to be fantastic! As you read, only small hints and pieces are revealed at a time so I was constantly hooked and on edge waiting for more so I could put everything together.\n\nI also really enjoyed the format and writing. There were lots of bits where it included a podcast or documentary transcript which also revealed more than what was already happening so you could prepare yourself for more. At time it felt like I was actually watching a true crime documentary unfold and I loved that!\n\nAs for the themes, there definitely are some darker undertones like grooming, pedophilia, abuse, and more. However, I think Jewell did an excellent job of weaving all this together in a way that made for a powerful story. The result was that the characters were complex and a bit morally grey so it made you question whether you should root for them or not in the end.\n\nOverall this was a solid thriller with some interesting twists at the end to the point where I feel like I\u2019m still digesting it all a few weeks later. This will likely go down as a top thriller of 2023 for me so don\u2019t miss out!\n\nRating: 5/5\n\nThanks @atriabooks for the copy, out Tuesday 8/8!", "total_engagement": 212, "engagement_rate":

While this satirical story can be polarizing, it still was perfect for book club because it created some invigorating discussion!\n\nThis book is one that has certainly been talked about since its release and with good reason. The plot is simple: Struggling author June Hayward, a white woman, accidentally witnesses the fluke-y death of her frenemy, Athena Liu and in the aftermath, June steals Athena\u2019s unpublished and unknown manuscript. Athena is a literary darling and June\u2019s own jealousy and need for fame justifies her passing along Athena\u2019s manuscript as her own. Thus ensues SO. MUCH. DRAMA.\n\nFirstly, it was such a bold choice for RFK to write this story from June\u2019s POV because June is probably one of the most despicable characters ever. She makes bad choice after bad choice and continues to dig her own grave, yet she completely thinks she\u2019s in the right the entire time. It was like watching a train wreck yet you could not look away because it was still so compelling to follow. And it would\u2019ve been so easy for June to avoid this mess in the first place if she was smart with her choices!\n\nThere was also the intricacies of the publishing industry that was brought up in this story which everyone found fascinating to learn more about. This brought up more great questions and discourse, one of the big ones of course being: who is allowed to write which stories? But then learning more about publishing made us really think about other topics like capitalism that really dictates a LOT and could be more of the issue.\n\nWhile there are parts that felt a bit more unbelievable than others and the ending maybe wrapped up a bit too quickly and came out of left field, overall it was a story that left everyone with a lot to think about. Plus it just felt SO meta, especially with all the Book Twitter and Goodreads references!\n\nAlso, it\u2019s worth noting that half the group listened to the audio while half read and it seems like those that read enjoyed it much more!

It started off quick: you learn about the different women in the neighborhood, their marriage, lives, etc. We also get a glimpse of this party where one of these women, Whitney, yells at your 10 year old son, Xavier\u2014 an incident everyone a the party witnesses. A few months later, Xavier falls from his bedroom window in the middle of the night and the mystery behind what happened becomes the gossip of the neighborhood.\n\nThis story is told in alternating POVs from four of the women on the street. While it was interesting to gain insight into each of their homes and lives, I\u2019ll be honest that at some points I felt like my interest wained and I found myself just not as invested into the story and happenings that were occurring in each home.\n\nThere\u2019s definitely a lot of complexity to this story though, especially when it came to motherhood. Each women\u2019s story was different yet seemed depict the dark side of what it\u2019s like being not only a mother, but also a spouse. We see how each of these women make different choices and how those choices impact their lives, the people around them, and intertwine with the other women.\n\nThis definitely felt a bit more character driven versus plot driven, which I don\u2019t mind! But there were definitely moments were I wanted this story to grip me, but it just didn\u2019t. Ultimately, though story still revolves around the mystery of what happened to Xavier that horrific night that he fell. And towards the end, it did read at a quicker pace and the ending had some revelations and an ending that will leave you befuddled.\n\nI still have some fairly mixed thoughts on this one. The characters weren\u2019t likable, there were some topics that were tough to read about, but at the same time the writing was well done and kept you hooked enough to finish. Overall I\u2019d say my feelings fall right in the middle!\n\nRating: 3/5\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Miscarriage & infertility are a big topic in this book and some of the scene are pretty graphic.", "total_engagement": 150, "engagement_rate": 0.011578541103820918, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-08-12T19:41:46.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "glimpse", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "whispers", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "women", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "writer", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "neighborhood", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "party", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sophomore novel", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "motherhood", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "pages", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "xavier", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9648606181144714}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132228589218, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-25T23:43:42.164Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-25T23:43:42.164Z"}, {"id": 607775132228589217, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1247306764", "created_at": "2023-08-25T23:43:42.161Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-25T23:43:42.161Z"}, {"id": 607775132229206057, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-26T03:53:23.762Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.889Z"}, {"id": 607775132229206060, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-26T03:53:23.814Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:44.896Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175245345840, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cv-8v9yPCUv/", "post_id": "3170238366662534447", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/ceea0fa35f827aa918cd020ce84bbe2b.JPEG", "phash": "980b1b5cf3cc8f26", "image_entities": [{"entity": "food", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4364790916442871}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24444293975830078}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6124657988548279}, {"entity": "picture frame", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5277808308601379}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3812798857688904}, {"entity": "tableware", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.35938549041748047}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2532796263694763}, {"entity": "computer monitor", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.252521812915802}, {"entity": "clock tower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23277899622917175}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-28T00:47:58.085Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T17:04:50.465Z"}}], "post_text": "MIXED SIGNALS - Book review!\n\nThis is the the third installment of the beloved LOVELIGHT series and I personally think it may have been my favorite one yet!\n\nWe have already gotten glimpses to both Layla and Caleb in previous stories and I was so excited to finally read their romance and it makes me happy that it was everything I had hoped!\n\nBeing transported back into Inglewood was such a joy because I have always loved the vibes and that small town feel and community. And of course we get plenty of appearances from some favorites like Stella & Luka and Beckett & Evie. Now, for Layla and Caleb, I did like their romance from the start! From the Hawaiian shirt to the month-long deal agreement to date each other, to the failed dates, sweet moments, and everything in between\u2014 I adored it!\n\nI also really liked both characters individually. Personally, I felt Layla\u2019s personality and story to be the most relatable to myself which is why I think this story resonated with me more than the others. And then there was Caleb who, while kind of a pushover at times, was so sweet and thoughtful and I loved seeing how he treated Layla.\n\nWhile their relationship definitely had its share of complications and well\u2026 mixed signals, I enjoyed seeing them both grow and become better versions of themselves and in turn make their relationship better. It was so easy to root for the two of them and overall it was just a feel-good type of read.\n\nAlso, this book seriously made me want to bake and eat so many delicious treats from cookies to cakes to croissants. So be prepared to go into this one craving all the baked goods!\n\nAnyway, I can\u2019t wait to eventually be back in Inglewood for Nova and Charlie\u2019s story!\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThank you @berkleyromance for the gifted digital copy!

Essentially, a commercial plane crashes into the ocean about 6 minutes into flight. Many people abandon the downed plane, but a group of 12 people remain onboard inside the aircraft as the plane sinks underwater. With only a few hours of oxygen left, the remaining survivors fight for their lives beneath the surface while a team above ground is simultaneously doing everything they can to save them.\n\nRight from the start, this story was filled with action and entertainment! The pacing was quick which made for an addicting read because it was almost impossible to put down once you started. I found myself immersed into the story and just so curious as to how everything would transpire and how the survival and rescue mission would go. Reading about the different characters and their behavior and action in this life or death scenario was fascinating because it made you really wonder about the perseverance and what you would do.\n\nDespite how compelling it was, there were still a few things that I struggled with. While I really appreciate the detail and behind the scenes of the plane itself, the training and nuances of being a part of the flight crew, etc., a lot of the writing still felt very technical where it took me out of the story a bit. Another thing was that I found there to be a few too many characters that it became hard to keep track of all the side characters and their roles. My last little struggle was with the MCs themselves, primarily Will. Of course I cannot imagine being stuck in life or death, survival scenario, but there were some actions and things he said that almost rubbed me the wrong way and made me not be a huge fan of him.\n\nOverall though, this was still one enjoyable and adrenaline fueled read! Plus it made me go down the wormhole of incredible recovery missions such as the Thailand Cave Rescue from a few years ago. It also really made you thing and wonder how you would handle being in this type of situation and what type of role you would play in it!\n\nRating: 3/5", "total_engagement": 7, "engagement_rate": 0.0005403319181783095, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-08-26T22:39:50.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "team", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "plane", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ocean", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "characters", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "side characters", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "everything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "survivors", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bookstagram", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "group", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "flight", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132257471361, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-01T21:27:44.243Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-01T21:27:44.243Z"}, {"id": 607775132257471360, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-165144628", "created_at": "2023-09-01T21:27:44.227Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-01T21:27:44.227Z"}, {"id": 607775132258904415, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-02T08:03:23.822Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-17T03:30:47.891Z"}, {"id": 607775132258904416, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-09-02T08:03:23.829Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-17T03:30:47.898Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175259160748, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CwgMmDpytd3/", "post_id": "3179596728744204151", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/e0dbb9de7bd96795edefef44fcf4ab29.JPEG", "phash": "dab1c41b64b8ca8f", "image_entities": [{"entity": "grass", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.940371036529541}, {"entity": "photograph", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.38742583990097046}, {"entity": "pink", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3062276542186737}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22953735291957855}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7947584390640259}, {"entity": "gate", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22085174918174744}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-04T00:20:09.649Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-03T20:14:25.635Z"}}], "post_text": "EMMA OF 83RD STREET - Book review!\n\nThis book is a modern day retelling of Jane Austen\u2019s classic novel, EMMA. To be honest, I have never read that classic and didn\u2019t even know too much about the premise, so some aspects of this retelling made me go \u201chmm\u201d before realizing that it truly was mimicking the original. \n\nThe Emma in this story comes from a wealthy family, a tight knit Upper East Side neighborhood, is currently in a graduate program, considers herself a matchmaker, and seems to innocently meddle into other people\u2019s lives because she truly believes she\u2019s helping. Her character was one I did struggle with at the beginning because I was not expecting, but after reading up on the original Emma, I learned that this is kind of the point. Emma is supposed to be a complicated heroine who grows and has self discovery throughout the course of the story. Once I knew this, everything made a lot more sense!\n\nThen there\u2019s the romance piece of the plot involving one of Emma\u2019s childhood friends and neighbor, George Knightley. Knightley is a few years older than Emma and has always seen her more like a kid sister, but know that they\u2019re older and both adults, he\u2019s seeing her in a brand new light. For the most part, I did enjoy the romance because I think childhood friends to lovers is always such a sweet trope! While the romance was a bit of a slow-burn and there were a ton of moments I was wanted to yell at both Emma and Knightley to just talk, I did appreciate how there wasn\u2019t really a third act breakup\u2014 something I almost find refreshing for romances!\n\nThough Emma\u2019s character did experience some growth, in some ways I was hoping for more because I felt like there was an opportunity to dig a little deeper as a lot of it felt surface level.\n\nOverall, this was a cute, modern romance that was an easy read. I enjoyed the dual POV as well as the found family aspect of the neighborhood and seeing Emma and Knightly\u2019s romance bloom. Still tbd if I will ever read the classic, but maybe one day!\n\nRating: 3.5/5\n\nThank you @gallerybooks for the gifted copy!", "total_engagement": 9, "engagement_rate": 0.0006947124662292551,

The plot sounded super cute, but I was disappointed that this book ended up being a miss for me.\n\nI\u2019ll start with what I liked. Firstly, the quaint countryside hotel vibes paired with its sweet owners and the small group of guests and employees was charming. I also liked the idea behind the premise: two employees race to find the owners of lost rings so they can (hopefully) get a reward to help save the hotel from going out of business. It was sweet and provided good commentary on the past and starting fresh. Lastly, I did appreciate both backstories for our MCs, Izzy and Lucas. They\u2019ve both dealt with grief and belonging, but show how vastly different they carry themselves.\n\nWhat I hard time with was Izzy and Lucas\u2019 romance. This was a workplace, enemies to lovers romance which in theory sounds like something I\u2019d like! But the execution of it was not my favorite.\n\nFor starters, I wasn\u2019t a fan of their reasonings to hate each other. It felt a little immature for two grown adults and I really disliked how they just avoided each other and made rash assumptions. And the way they behaved around others, forcing innocent people to have to step into their feuds was weird to me. Sure, some of this was addressed at the end of the story, but it just seemed too far fetched for me and by the time the explanations and apologies came around, I was already over it.\n\nThere was also something about the writing and POVs of our characters that grated on me and felt repetitive. Like during Izzy\u2019s chapters, we were always reminded of how broody and muscular Lucas was. Also being that the POVs were in first person perspective, I found their thoughts and views (mostly Izzy\u2019s) to be super frustrating at times.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m sad this didn\u2019t quite work out for me, but I can see how others may enjoy it more than I did!\n\nRating: 3/5\n\nThank you @berkleyromance for the gifted digital copy out 9/23!

sharing July\u2019s pick! Fiona Davis was a new author to most, she is definitely one that everyone will read more of!\n\nThe book is set in New York during the 50s, a time when the infamous Big Apple Bomber was inciting fear in the city. The story follows Marion, a 19 year old who leaves behind the safe life her father wants of her and instead pursues her dream of the arts like her late mother, and lands herself a spot as a Radio City Rockette. As Marion gains more independence, she finds herself befriending a doctor named Peter and the two become involved in the search for the Big Apple Bomber thanks to Peter\u2019s interest in profiling.\n\nWhile being a historical fiction at its core, this book also blended other genres like mystery + coming of age. It was fun to see Marion make her own choices and become independent from her family. But also, you saw the struggles she faced with the pressure from her father to follow the \u201csafe\u201d route in life instead of following her heart.\n\nAs for the historical aspect, everyone really loved learning more about the Rockettes and learning more about the behind the scenes of the infamous group, especially in its early days. Secondly, it was fascinating to learn more about the Big Apple Bomber and how that case was one of the firsts to use criminal profiling to find the perpetrator. A lot of the details and story around the case were accurately portrayed in this story which made it even more interesting!\n\nThis story also had a lot of emotional moments within its pages particularly when it come to themes surrounding family. The 50s were a bit of a different time when it came to the expectation and roles of men and women and this book definitely depicted that at times.\n\nThe reason for pause is that even though this is still fiction and creative liberties are to be expected, the ending felt a bit over the top and you really had to suspend disbelief.

Six years later, Vesper is working as a waitress and just making ends meet when she receives an invite to her cousin\u2019s wedding back in her hometown. What comes of all this are some dark secrets, a very dysfunctional family, some horror, and some laughs.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to really say too much about this story without giving anything away, but I will say it\u2019s best to go into it fairly blind aside from the basic premise! Because there was a bit of a surprise that happened around the 50 page mark that will make the story way more fun if you don\u2019t already know it\u2019s coming. I personally was taken aback by it that I had to read it twice and be like \u201cwow this author went there!\u201d, but in the most complimenting way!\n\nAs we learned more about Vesper, her past, and the events of the present day, the story just flew by and was so entertaining that it was hard to stop reading. While it was unique and outrageous in its own way, I did also appreciate how it brought up topics such as small towns with distinct ideologies, family, becoming your own person, and more.\n\nPlus the ending of this one was just wild! There were so many moments where I was thinking to myself \u201cis this really happening?!\u201d. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed this more than I had expected and would recommend for the fall and spooky season if you\u2019re looking for something a little bit weird and culty, but with a creative and highly entertaining story, then you should this one out!\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThanks so much @berkleypub for the gifted copy!

Willy Wonka and after finishing it, I can see why that is the case.\n\nFor her entire childhood our MC, Lucy, was unloved by her family. Her solace as the children\u2019s book series, Clock Island, by Jack Masterson. She is now 26 years old, working as a teacher\u2019s aide in California, after having left her home state of Maine. At the school she has formed a close connection with a 7 year old foster child, Christopher. The two have made wishes that Lucy formally adopt him and that may come true after Lucy is invited to participate in a game on the real Clock Island, hosted by the recluse, Jack Masterson himself.\n\nFor starters, I found the premise of this idea fun and charming. Jack is very much modeled like Willy Wonka and while he did seem genuine in wanting to help children out of dark places, something also felt off for me. Clock Island though was a charming place and I loved the message of how books can really be an escape. The game itself was full of riddles and fun, albeit a bit simplistic and rushed through.\n\nThere was also Hugo, the illustrator who redesigned the covers of the series. He has been at Jack\u2019s side on the island for 13 years, but finds himself wanting more out of life outside the island. Hugo is English and grumpy, but also artistic, thoughtful, and funny. He was a fun character and I liked him as an individual, however\u2026\n\nI wasn\u2019t a fun of the romance storyline with him and Lucy. They first met when she was 13 and he 21 (though nothing happened) and now after meeting again as adults their infatuation with each other was icky and I don\u2019t think that plot line was necessary.\n\nI also was not a fan of Lucy. She started off fine, but then as the story progressed her character started to bother me and I never found myself rooting for her. Lastly, while I understand why there is trauma in this story, it also felt like the author threw in every difficult topic, which became a bit cumbersome.\n\nOverall, it was a quick read and I did appreciate how it discussed the foster care system. However, I did have high hopes for this and sadly it still fell a little flat.\n\nRating: 3/5\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f in comments", "total_engagement": 9, "engagement_rate": 0.0006947124662292551, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-09-21T23:08:52.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "jack masterson", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "family", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mc", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lucy", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "willy wonka", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "wishing game", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hugo", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "childhood", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "clock island", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132331297523, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-29T23:15:20.840Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-29T23:15:20.840Z"}, {"id": 607775132331297522, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-822406504", "created_at": "2023-09-29T23:15:20.837Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-29T23:15:20.837Z"}, {"id": 607775132333338369, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:45.359Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T03:27:06.240Z"}, {"id": 607775132333338370, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-10-02T07:45:45.365Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T03:27:06.246Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175299178067, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cxys4sNynbs/", "post_id": "3202819694827042540", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": "{\"id\":\"224233720\",\"has_public_page\":true,\"name\":\"Estes Park, Colorado\",\"slug\":\"estes-park-colorado\"}", "latitude": 45.4883, "longitude": -110.526}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/1c155e7f37cadd1870b17524386e0dfb.JPEG", "phash": "a4df81c46c9fe0c6", "image_entities": [{"entity": "grass", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2767091989517212}, {"entity": "mug", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7387041449546814}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7042152881622314}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2802954912185669}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-11T22:13:12.421Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-18T15:52:01.886Z"}}], "post_text": "A little throwback photo to last year in Colorado because these reading views were everything l.\n\nI haven\u2019t been posting much lately because the algorithm has been kick my but even more than usual nowadays and it has honestly made me lose some motivation to post things. \ud83d\ude43\n\nBUT I am still here and reading lots!

And now a month later, I still don\u2019t think I have the words to succinctly write a review for how special this book is. Part magical realism, part historical fiction, part dark academia, this book covered so much.\n\nFirstly, this definitely one of those books where the writing is so beautiful and insightful that you just have to slowly savor to truly appreciate it. A huge component of this book is about Babel and how it\u2019s academic focus is linguistics and translation and that in itself was incredibly fascinating to read and learn about, particularly in the context of the overall story.\n\nThere was also the dark academia angle too which I of course enjoyed. While the story is told from the perspective of one Babel academic, Robin, you get to experience everything through his eyes. Like with many books of this genre, there was the interesting dynamics amongst the small cohort of students within Babel. From friendship to rivalries and betrayals to underground societies, things got quite complicated at times, BUT it made for such an entertaining read!\n\nThe other big themes brought up were racism and colonialism. The latter of which is a topic that I can honestly say I have not read of outside of school textbooks, but RFK wrote about it in such a perceptive and clever way that it really made you think about those historical times when colonization was at it\u2019s peak. Because of this, it brought up so many other discussions around things like race and power. My only minor criticism is that there were times where I wished the message was a bit more subtle instead of being so blatant. But again, just a minor thing.\n\nWhile this book may seem daunting and dense to read and may not necessarily be or everyone, I am so glad I (finally) got around to it! It was just so well done and even created a range of emotions from frustration, heartbreak, and more. This was my second book by this author (after YELLOWFACE I made it a priority to read more) and I can honestly say that I\u2019m a fan of her work and am eager to see what she puts out next!\n\nRating: 4.5/5", "total_engagement": 126, "engagement_rate": 0.009725974527209571, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-10-02T21:51:47.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "babel", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "review", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "arcane history", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "babel", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "words", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "books", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "robin", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9322478175163269}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132365121200, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-13T21:15:26.811Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-13T21:15:26.811Z"}, {"id": 607775132365121197, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-2057680188", "created_at": "2023-10-13T21:15:26.801Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-13T21:15:26.801Z"}, {"id": 607775132373745299, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-17T03:30:48.206Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T03:27:06.290Z"}, {"id": 607775132373745300, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-10-17T03:30:48.213Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T03:27:06.297Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175299178053, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CyMgX89v1Jl/", "post_id": "3210083017905099365", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/c52daebc56e208b73dc7db4bbe569dfb.JPEG", "phash": "e0ca4734b6b293e9", "image_entities": [{"entity": "disk", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7450892925262451}, {"entity": "dvd", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7356928586959839}, {"entity": "advertisement", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3530907928943634}, {"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.25320470333099365}, {"entity": "paper", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24356906116008759}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20928695797920227}, {"entity": "clock tower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7624524235725403}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7334684133529663}, {"entity": "window blind", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6297823786735535}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6265639066696167}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5122941732406616}, {"entity": "window blind", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4407573342323303}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.32373061776161194}, {"entity": "window blind", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22861133515834808}, {"entity": "bagged packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22195930778980255}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-11T22:13:58.658Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-18T15:51:22.982Z"}}], "post_text": "THE FURY - Book review!\n\nAlex Michaelides is back with a new thriller and I have to say it did feel a bit different than his past work\u2026 and in an exciting and fun way!\n\nThis story definitely has more of a locked room, murder mystery/ whodunnit vibes that even has lots of references and pays homage to Agatha Christie. Plus there was a quirky and very unreliable narrator which made things interesting because it truly became difficult to know what to believe and who to trust as the story progressed and more details emerged.\n\nEssentially the premise follows a group of wealthy and artistic friends to a private Greek island where soon after arrival, one of them ends up dead. There\u2019s only so many people who could\u2019ve committed the act so the mystery of who and why becomes the overarching plot.\n\nI did find the story to be a bit slow in the beginning, primarily because it was introducing each of the characters and their relationships with each other and describing the day-to-day events leading up to the island stay as well as what occurred leading up to the murder. It totally made sense to build up the foundation, but I just find there to be a lack of action which made for a slow burn.\n\nHowever, as mentioned above, there was an unreliable narrator and I do think his narrative helped keep things exciting because it felt like you knew where things were headed and then all of a sudden he would pivot in another direction and totally change course which made you second guess everything.\n\nAnd then there was the ending which was quite explosive and wild that it felt like whiplash\u2026 if there was a good kind of whiplash! So many revelations came out and the truth around everything became apparent and it was just smartly executed that it had me going \u201cooooh!\u201d.\n\nOverall, this was a fine read that bordered on a tragic love story. A tad slow, but if you stick with it, you might just find the ending worth it. Plus the Greek island setting was fun and there are a couple of tiny throwbacks to characters in both of Michaelides\u2019 previous books which are always fun little easter eggs!\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThanks @celadonbooks for the gifted copy!

This part very much reminded me of Encanto, right down to the powers they had. And I loved Encanto, so that\u2019s saying something!\n\nAnywho, Sage is our MC and we follow her through her journey of love, forgiveness, and identity and it was a heartwarming story. Firstly, there\u2019s the ghost of her younger sister Sky, who tragically passed eight years ago. Sage has been trying to figure out who to get Sky\u2019s ghost peace and learns that in order to do so, she must talk and heal the fraught relationship she has with her other younger sister, Teal. This subplot definitely explores many topics such as grief, guilt, and more and was done in its own unique way by weaving in these fun magical elements.\n\nThere was also the romance angle too. While there were some parts that I liked\u2014 for example the throwback to instant messenger with the funky screen names\u2014 there were also a few things I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of. Namely the fact that Sage withheld info from her love interest, Tennessee. But ultimately their work adventures together in botany and the second chance trope made for a sweet enough story.\n\nWhile this may not have been groundbreaking in any ways, if you are just looking for a quick fall read, this may just do the trick!\n\nRating: 3/5\n\nThanks so much @berkleyromance for the gifted copy!", "total_engagement": 135, "engagement_rate": 0.010420686993438826, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-10-17T22:38:01.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sisterhood", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "romance", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sage flores", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sky", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "need", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "vibes", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132398313120, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "2", "created_at": "2023-10-25T23:24:08.261Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T22:04:15.233Z"}, {"id": 607775132398313119, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-2088790488", "created_at": "2023-10-25T23:24:08.250Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T22:04:15.208Z"}, {"id": 607775132398485906, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "2", "created_at": "2023-10-26T03:27:35.336Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-17T03:27:22.803Z"}, {"id": 607775132398485907, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-10-26T03:27:35.342Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-17T03:27:22.814Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175314002528, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CyrRtoQyBhs/", "post_id": "3218744261084715116", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/c0ba8d35b8dba758d991b02be7c9aa20.JPEG", "phash": "aeb452b12c86fa65", "image_entities": [{"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 1.0}, {"entity": "bookcase", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9999990463256836}, {"entity": "furniture", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9999849796295166}, {"entity": "library", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9999833106994629}, {"entity": "publication", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9999459981918335}, {"entity": "room", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9998958110809326}, {"entity": "shelf", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9995991587638855}, {"entity": "bookselling", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8954709768295288}, {"entity": "shelving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7467841506004333}, {"entity": "collection", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.40785378217697144}, {"entity": "public library", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.264475554227829}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5213796496391296}, {"entity": "bookcase", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5021898746490479}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.49282434582710266}, {"entity": "crib", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.38648486137390137}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.37820732593536377}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3466123640537262}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.33288002014160156}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.30683931708335876}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-25T00:25:46.675Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-05T14:03:34.342Z"}}], "post_text": "A little shelfie this Saturday purely in the name of content!\n\nOctober\u2019s been a busy month for me and it\u2019s also shaping up to be the worst reading month I\u2019ve had in probably the last couple years \ud83e\udee3\n\nBut that\u2019s okay!!

It\u2019s very much your typical coming of age book as it was filled with hardships and some anguish, but also had its moment of pure tenderness and warmth.\n\nOne thing to note is this book is much more character vs. plot driven as it very much focuses on the development and relationship of both Ari and Dante and how the events that occur play a pivotal role in shaping them. Of course there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with books that are more character based, but I do know that some people may not vibe as much with that and much prefer stories where there is a known plot. So like with many books, this factor may dictate how one person enjoys it over another!\n\nBack to the book, we did all enjoy reading the story from Ari\u2019s perspective because even though it is one that none of us could directly relate to, reading it still gave us so much more understanding to the internal conflicts of a young teen grasping with his identity. It was written in such a way where Ari and Dante\u2019s emotions and everything happening felt so poignant and raw that it made for more powerful moments.\n\nAnother thing that everyone did really appreciate about this story was just how awesome and supportive the parents of both Ari and Dante were. While the story also depicted some of the struggles of the family dynamics, it showed the importance of having really amazing parents and there were scenes that were very heartwarming to read about.\n\nRatings amongst everyone varied between around 3-4.5 and shows just how subjective reading is!!", "total_engagement": 134, "engagement_rate": 0.010343496719413354, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-10-24T22:47:01.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "coming of age book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "aristotle", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "stories", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "events", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ari", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "books", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "boys", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132448435510, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-13T22:04:15.440Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T22:04:15.440Z"}, {"id": 607775132448435508, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "95471751", "created_at": "2023-11-13T22:04:15.436Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T22:04:15.436Z"}, {"id": 607775132448691464, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-14T03:28:45.791Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-01T03:41:32.581Z"}, {"id": 607775132448691466, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-11-14T03:28:45.808Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-01T03:41:32.587Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175336452420, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cy4PaW7vljQ/", "post_id": "3222393315412302032", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/f6494125dc221a83e060b5ae83854d58.JPEG", "phash": "beb1d163931cccc4", "image_entities": [{"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8825652599334717}, {"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7256468534469604}, {"entity": "coffee", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4283231496810913}, {"entity": "cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3242883086204529}, {"entity": "drink", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23999108374118805}, {"entity": "grapefruit", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22514978051185608}, {"entity": "food", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21967877447605133}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7161804437637329}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6933507323265076}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6227362751960754}, {"entity": "coffee cup", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4677741527557373}, {"entity": "tableware", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4413336217403412}, {"entity": "mug", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.26071590185165405}, {"entity": "canned packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24454379081726074}, {"entity": "pumpkin", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22904768586158752}, {"entity": "soccer ball", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22524328529834747}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-14T00:48:29.476Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-26T15:31:04.844Z"}}], "post_text": "MISERY \u2013 Book review! And my first King in two years!\n\u00a0\nQuick little blurb for those unfamiliar: Best selling novelist of the Misery Chastain series, Paul Sheldon, is in a car accident, but saved by his number one fan and nurse, Annie Wilkes. Annie takes Paul back to her isolated Colorado home where she nurses him back to health, but upon hearing that Misery has been killed off in the latest novel, she forces Paul to write another story bringing Misery back to life.\n\u00a0\nI feel like this book made me so anxious because it read from Paul\u2019s POV and the whole time you just had no idea what Annie was up to. Plus her moods were so unpredictable that one minute she could be fine and the next, she was on a rampage and when she was on one, you never knew what she might do! While I knew this book was going to be creepy heading in, some of Annie\u2019s actions and cruelty still took me by surprise!\n\u00a0\nI also found this story to just be so well done and clever for different reasons. One being that there really only were two characters throughout the entirety of this book: Paul and Annie. Both were well developed and even though it was just two characters, the story still moved at such a good pace and it never felt stale and like you needed something more. Plus there was also the psychological aspect from Paul\u2019s perspective as he was being held captive and tortured (in various ways) on top of being forced to write a Misery story to Annie\u2019s satisfaction. A decent chunk of the book was in Paul\u2019s head and getting his thoughts and seeing his internal fight for survival was great.\n\u00a0\nThere were some revelations in the later half of the book too, particularly about Annie, that was fascinating from a psychopathy standpoint. And then the ending was insanely explosive and most definitely not for the faint of heart as it had some pretty descriptive and gory scenes as you may expect.\n\u00a0\nWhile it did have its terrifying moments, I really didn\u2019t find this book to be as scary as I thought it might be. It definitely spooked me at times though and I can 100% see why the movie adaption would be horrifying and I can say with certainty that I will steer clear of that!\n\u00a0\nRating: 4/5", "total_engagement": 145, "engagement_rate": 0.011192589733693555, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-10-26T22:27:19.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "king", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "novelist", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fan", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "car accident", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "paul sheldon", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "series", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "misery chastain", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "home", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "annie wilkes", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9449000358581543}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132448435515, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-13T22:04:15.534Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T22:04:15.534Z"}, {"id": 607775132448435514, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1024994253", "created_at": "2023-11-13T22:04:15.531Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T22:04:15.531Z"}, {"id": 607775132448691469, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-14T03:28:45.833Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-01T03:41:32.616Z"}, {"id": 607775132448691472, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-11-14T03:28:45.851Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-01T03:41:32.624Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175336452421, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CzCo164PF90/", "post_id": "3225319910363914100", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/9441b7698d2296987d7f5f55ef13026d.JPEG", "phash": "d3216f1709138f57", "image_entities": [{"entity": "calabaza", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9709059596061707}, {"entity": "orange", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9698901176452637}, {"entity": "pumpkin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.529120147228241}, {"entity": "vegetable", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3732512891292572}, {"entity": "winter squash", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.35576295852661133}, {"entity": "football", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6445151567459106}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5571110844612122}, {"entity": "balloon", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5332974195480347}, {"entity": "soccer ball", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4489286541938782}, {"entity": "soccer ball", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.395509272813797}, {"entity": "pumpkin", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3899816870689392}, {"entity": "soccer ball", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3876034915447235}, {"entity": "football", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3612842857837677}, {"entity": "picture frame", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.35442811250686646}, {"entity": "football", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.30293723940849304}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2917882800102234}, {"entity": "ball", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24701717495918274}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-14T00:48:33.780Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-26T15:31:16.223Z"}}], "post_text": "THE BROKEN GIRLS \u2013 Book club review!\n\u00a0\nThis book was perfect for the spooky fall season because it blended a few different themes very nicely from thriller/ mystery and paranormal with hints of historical fiction and dark academia. The pacing made the story move along quickly and it was compelling enough to keep interest and want to see how everything panned out at the end.\n\u00a0\nThis story alternated between two different timelines. One is in 1950 at the haunted grounds of Idlewild, a boarding school for young girls with seemingly nowhere else to go. During this time, there are four girls who room together and though they are all different with distinct personalities, they form a special bond. When one of them goes missing, the others make it their mission to find out what happened. The second timeline takes place 60+ years later. Fiona is a journalist who is still grieving the murder of her sister after her body was found dumped in the abandoned Idlewild property 20 years ago. Her killer was convicted, but after a mysterious person buys the Idlewild with plans to restore it, Fiona finds herself digging into the past and uncovering secrets from the 50s as well as about her sister\u2019s case.\n\u00a0\nBoth the timelines were interesting for their own reasons. With the girls in the boarding school, it was horrific to learn about their pasts and what led them there as well as just that time period. A significant part of the plot also discussed WWII and the atrocities of concentration camps and its survivors which was something that was unexpected heading in, but made a lasting impression. In the present day, it was fun following Fiona as she learned more about the happenings at both Idlewild and within her small town, particularly when it come to corruption.\n\u00a0\nWhile certain aspects of the book were a tad predictable, there were still some surprises with just how intricate things were and how complicit some characters were when it came to events in the past.\n\u00a0\nOverall, this was the perfect read for the season with just the right amount of mix of everything. It wasn\u2019t too scary at all, but still gave off those eerie vibes!\n\u00a0\nGroup rating: 4/5", "total_engagement": 130, "engagement_rate": 0.010034735623311463, "network_type": "instagram",

It takes the horrors of Ted Bundy, one of the most notorious and prolific serial killers, but flips the script. Instead of the story being focused on him (as so many stories often are), it\u2019s about the women who were his victims. So much so that the author chose to not once use his name, but instead referred to him solely as The Defendant, and I thought this spoke volumes! In some ways too, this book even felt like a character study of the many different women and people whose lives were irrevocably changed because of this one man.\n\nThe story was told in three different timelines: one in 1974 from the POV of Ruth who eventually becomes one of The Defendant\u2019s victims in Washington state. Then there\u2019s Pamela in 1978, a student and the sorority chapter president at FSU, who witnesses The Defendant leaving the house after murdering and injuring several of her sisters. And finally there\u2019s Pamela in the present day of 2021. While each of their timelines were fascinating in their own way, I do have to say that Pamela\u2019s 1978 POV was my favorite because I felt her character was written so well and I really appreciated her perspective.\n\nWhile I did also like the story of Ruth and her relationship with Tina (who also appears in the other timelines), I did feel like there were jumps within those chapters and at times it made it difficult to keep track of what was happening. But Ruth\u2019s story was also very powerful for its own reasons.\n\nOverall I found this to be a super addicting and compelling read where I felt like I learned so much. It also creeped me out more than a lot of other books I\u2019ve read, because of the fact it was all based off true events. Plus it totally sent me down the serial killer rabbit hole which probably didn\u2019t help\n\nIf this sounds like something up your alley, I would definitely recommend!\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThank you @bookclubfavorites for the gifted copy!", "total_engagement": 143, "engagement_rate": 0.01103820918564261, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-08T22:43:22.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "women", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "course", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "plenty", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "pamela", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "author", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "the defendant", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ruth", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "release", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "women", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "praise", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "bookclubfavorites"}], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9818699359893799}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132448435563, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-13T22:04:15.860Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T22:04:15.860Z"}, {"id": 607775132448435562, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "56016746", "created_at": "2023-11-13T22:04:15.854Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T22:04:15.854Z"}, {"id": 607775132448691487, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-14T03:28:45.965Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-01T03:41:32.717Z"}, {"id": 607775132448691491, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-11-14T03:28:45.989Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-01T03:41:32.731Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175345770418, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CzrzWsivokG/", "post_id": "3236906617223940358", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/3c21a6a33e8780f5c7349595052dfde7.JPEG", "phash": "be5e1eada1e2c142", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beauty", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.62290358543396}, {"entity": "cup", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22400037944316864}, {"entity": "pink", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21269018948078156}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8433369994163513}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7777527570724487}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7152134776115417}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5191823840141296}, {"entity": "tableware", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.41211962699890137}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-25T02:43:06.541Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-26T01:42:19.501Z"}}], "post_text": "I\u2019M GLAD MY MOM DIED - Book thoughts!\n\nI\u2019m sure many of you have seen enough reviews and praise for this memoir to know it\u2019s about the relationship Jennette McCurdy had with her mother from childhood all the way until her mother\u2019s passing when she was 21.\n\nThis memoir is heartbreaking, frustrating, yet brutally honest in its reflection of the events that occurred starting from when Jennette was just six years old. The first half of the memoir covers the \u201cbefore\u201d years of her mothers death and I found myself shocked at the things described, yet really appreciative of the candid way of which this was done. My heart broke for the younger Jennette who thought sacrificing her own happiness for her mother\u2019s trumped everything. It is so sad to think about how she lost so many of those formative years in her childhood and never had that opportunity to just be a kid. Even as she continued to grow older, her mother played a pivotal role in everything including her eating habits, relationships, and more.\n\nThe second half of the memoir was also tough to stomach at times, but so so important because it covers some very dark topics such as grief, alcohol addiction, eating disorders, and overall mental health. It\u2019s here where Jennette begins to truly come to terms with the full impact her mother's manipulation and abuse had and how all the ideas and comments she fed her throughout the years led Jennette to having a warped view of herself and how to approach life.\n\nThere were so many moments where her pain felt so visceral and I felt so angry at her mother for putting her through this. However, you begin to see the road to recovery and though its not pretty by any means, I appreciated the way this was written to show that it is an incredible challenge and one that will always be ongoing.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this memoir! It was also very accessible in the sense of it being very easy to read and follow along and not dense in any way. It read quickly and was super compelling throughout because let\u2019s be real\u2026 human curiosity is a real thing it was just astounding to get a glimpse into this life story.", "total_engagement": 199, "engagement_rate": 0.015360864531069085, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-15T23:02:39.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "challenge", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "memoir", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "jennette mccurdy", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "relationship", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reviews", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "events", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "many", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mom", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mother", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "childhood", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "praise", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132470757459, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-23T00:24:05.593Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-23T00:24:05.593Z"}, {"id": 607775132470757457, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1878671822", "created_at": "2023-11-23T00:24:05.567Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-23T00:24:05.567Z"}, {"id": 607775132473522754, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-24T03:35:45.308Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-01T03:43:01.096Z"}, {"id": 607775132473522755, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-11-24T03:35:45.312Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-01T03:43:01.106Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175345770390, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Czw0VE6Sryb/", "post_id": "3238318278879919259", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/28a55c452a417d2e3852efe0617c04b5.JPEG", "phash": "b8c5278e69bc8ce4", "image_entities": [{"entity": "hand", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.25291115045547485}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8490847945213318}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7354183197021484}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7073488235473633}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6977022886276245}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5504984855651855}, {"entity": "watch", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.47084274888038635}, {"entity": "wheel", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.39903372526168823}, {"entity": "single-lens reflex camera", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.37453752756118774}, {"entity": "wristwatch", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.28077179193496704}, {"entity": "camera", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24544547498226166}, {"entity": "throw pillow", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.202106773853302}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-25T02:43:54.632Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-26T01:41:53.730Z"}}], "post_text": "AN UNEXPECTED PATH - Book review & a very happy pub day to @authormegmcspadden !\n\nSo a few years ago, back in my baby bookstagram days, Meg and I connected about books of course, but also for our mutual love of ice hockey. Since then, not only have we chatted on many things, but Meg has now written a whole dang book! It\u2019s been so cool seeing her writing journey and this amazing accomplishment!\n\nThis is a contemporary romance that includes things like: forced proximity, honest and lovable characters, lots of dogs including one named Yogurt, tension!, fall vibes, hilarious moments, emotional depth, and so much more.\n\nOne of the biggest standouts to me about this story were the characters in Marley and Bennett. They\u2019re thrown together due to unforeseen circumstances  They each have their own backgrounds as well as struggles and I really admired the connection they had to be able to share their vulnerabilities and just communicate! \u2014 it made me love them even more! I also found so much value in the topics brought up around being a conflict photographer, PTSD, mental health, and the dangers of CTE. Nothing felt super forced, but just\u2026 authentic. While I was of course invested into the romance plot, I also found myself equally into both Marley and Bennett\u2019s individual journey\u2019s of healing and growth.\n\nI also have to hand it to Meg for thawing my cold heart on the idea of insta-love. Historically it\u2019s a trope that I\u2019ve struggled with, but I knew and could appreciate heading in that this kind of love story is dear to her because of her own experiences! Usually I have a hard time because I just don\u2019t feel that connection between love interests, but this one was done sooo well where it felt truly genuine where it didn\u2019t seem that fast and you couldn\u2019t help but root for Marley and Bennett!\n\nOverall this felt like such a feel good and wholesome read! Plus it had some clever jokes and one-liners that had me giggling! I absolutely cannot wait to see what is next!\n\nThis debut is officially available today, so go out and support your indie authors and snag yourself a copy (physical or digital!) on Amazon

Squeezing in this review before November ends!\n\nI very much have been in the mood for some non fictions and memoirs lately so I figured it was time that I finally get my hands on this critically acclaimed memoir from Jeannette Walls!\n\nThis memoir tells the story of Jeannette\u2019s upbringing from a young child and into adulthood. Her father was an alcoholic with a distrust in the government and typical societal norms, but was also very charismatic and dreamed big. Her mother was very distant from her children with her own aspirations of being an artist and almost seemingly blamed them for getting in the way of that.\n\nThere were so many heartbreaking moments mentioned during her childhood. From just the constant poverty they lived in primarily in part due to her parents\u2019 choices in doing what they felt was \u201cbest\u201d for the family. The good part out of this was the bond Jeannette had with her siblings and how they looked out for each other even during he hard times. They took on responsibilities most normal kids their ages would never do, but did to survive. On top of that, there were also stories of how Jeannette was exposed to sexual assault at a young age, but her parents turned a blind eye to it. It was absolutely devastating to read about and at moments wasn\u2019t an easy read.\n\nI think what really stood out to me though was how well written this memoir was. Despite the struggles she (and her siblings) experienced during their childhood and adolescence, Jeannette did such an amazing job of really creating that juxtaposition between love and anger towards her parents. As an outsiders, it can be easy to look at this family and be infuriated with the way the parents behaved and raised their kids. But the way Jeannette tells it, you can still sense there is a lot of love there and that things really can be complicate when it comes to family.\n\nLastly, I found the part taking place in NYC to be fascinating, especially when it came to her parents and their lifestyle. It was just shocking to read, but ultimately it was also amazing to see how Jeannette and her siblings grew into their own person.\n\nOverall I highly suggest this memoir!", "total_engagement": 10, "engagement_rate": 0.0007719027402547279, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-30T19:24:41.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132504469101, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-09T20:57:54.155Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-09T20:57:54.155Z"}, {"id": 607775132504469097, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1236619303", "created_at": "2023-12-09T20:57:54.147Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-09T20:57:54.147Z"}, {"id": 607775132504938279, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-10T03:47:02.722Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-01T03:43:01.210Z"}, {"id": 607775132504938280, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-12-10T03:47:02.748Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-01T03:43:01.215Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175357167392, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C0Zdf2sLMxF/", "post_id": "3249758338500316229", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": "Boston, Massachusetts", "latitude": 42.3584, "longitude": -71.0598}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/5f40cf8ca3dd7272ba2d9b9b92a1ed51.JPEG", "phash": "e4bb41865dc9c6e8", "image_entities": [{"entity": "breakfast", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9859824776649475}, {"entity": "brunch", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.819424033164978}, {"entity": "cuisine", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7116739749908447}, {"entity": "dish", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6563952565193176}, {"entity": "food", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4254612624645233}, {"entity": "ingredient", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.36929455399513245}, {"entity": "full breakfast", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24047407507896423}, {"entity": "meal", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23314382135868073}, {"entity": "sunglasses", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9602504968643188}, {"entity": "ice cream", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.790152907371521}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6611907482147217}, {"entity": "computer monitor", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5201560854911804}, {"entity": "muffin", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4881114363670349}, {"entity": "canned packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.34932512044906616}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.30201828479766846}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2607616186141968}, {"entity": "plate", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2478385865688324}, {"entity": "knife", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20830675959587097}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-09T02:14:11.052Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-26T01:42:38.365Z"}}], "post_text": "Boston photo dump \ud83d\udc9b\n\nIt was a quick trip this time around, but as is typical, was filled with lots of food + family time and was perfect.

Sharing some mini reviews of a few holiday books I\u2019ve read recently!\n\nFAKING CHRISTMAS - A cute Christmas romance that includes fake dating + enemies to lovers! There\u2019s also a bit of dysfunctional family element going on here that made things fun and kept me on my toes. The farm setting was dreamy and there were so many wonderful and cozy vibes and laughable moments that made this a nice holiday read. My biggest issue was that the miscommunication was dragged the heck out, primarily because our FMC, Laurel, refused to listen/ talk to the MMC, Max. But I did appreciate that there was no third act breakup! Though you have to suspend some disbelief, overall this was a quick and fun read! Rating: 3/5\n\nBRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CHRISTMAS - Another quick holiday read that involves a small town girl in NYC. There\u2019s a small family run tree stand, an old camper van named Spammy, an eclectic mix of neighbors, some sibling tension, turf wars, and more! This story just exuded all the cozy Christmas vibes and I loved following our MC\u2019s journey in working with her distant brother to run the family business for her first time. She experiences friendship, love, rediscovers her passion for art, and just grows as a person. While a tad cheesy, this book really encapsulated the joy of the holidays + had some heartwarming found family vibes! Rating: 4/5\n\nUNLEASHED HOLIDAY - So. Many. Dogs! While categorized as a holiday, this one doesn\u2019t solely cover the winter festivities, but starts in October so includes Halloween, Thanksgiving, with Christmas being the finale! The premise was cute with enemies with a past history who are now rival business owners. There\u2019s also some chaotic family dynamics, mean and sassy goats, and even themes of grief. The main issue I had with it was similar to what was said in the first book review. I know miscommunication is pretty par for the course in contemporary romances, but I hate when that causes an MC to be rude and judgmental based of those preconceived notions. Overall though, just another standard holiday read to get you in the mood for the season!

The general premise is that \u201cgirls\u201d trip to Atlantic City to tie up some loose ends turns into a crazy adventure once the getaway turns into a family affair and police investigation.\n\nAdmittedly, I felt myself slightly losing some interest in the last book of this series, BUT I am so happy that this fourth one really established my love for Finlay and all the hilarious antics and situations she finds herself in. While you of course have to suspend disbelief, I think a lot of the fun in it is how outrageous the scenarios are and its such a funny and feel-good kind of read with some added mystery and suspense to it.\n\nThe Atlantic City setting of this particular story really did make for a fun time because it was filled with casinos, gambling, (more) dead guys, one memorable time in Chubbie, a dog named Kevin Bacon, and more over the top shenanigans. While there was a lot going in, I did love how it kept me guessing as to how everything was connected with the events of the previous stories and it was cool seeing how other little details reappeared to tie things together.\n\nWhile the ending did wrap up quite a few of the storylines, it also did leave one little cliffhanger so it definitely seems like there will be more to come! And if you have not yet checked out this series and murder mysteries are your thing\u2026 what are you waiting for?\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThank you @minotaurbooks for the gifted copy of this highly anticipated read!

If stories about rich families with messed up dynamics particularly when it comes to inheritance and \u201cwhat is rightfully theirs\u201d, than this may be a book for you.\n\nThe eeriness of the story is set early on with the kidnapping and return of three year old, Ruby McTavish, in a small North Carolina town near the Appalachians. Ruby is the heiress to the great McTavish family fortune and lived quite a life until her death. In the present, Camden is summoned back to his childhood home to deal with the family he cut off all relations with and who despise him back. He brings along his wife, Jules, for support and their visit is the catalyst to unveiling long hidden secrets about different individuals and the family as a whole.\n\nOne thing I really enjoyed about this book was the different POVs and formats included. Not only do we get dual perspectives from both Camden and Jules, but we also get newspaper articles/ clippings from decades ago as well as more recently, and finally there are letters written by Ruby prior to her death that explain much of her past actions and why she did certain things. All of these different narratives and format did create a cohesive and engaging story that had me continually curious and wanting more. It helped that this also read SUPER quickly and was very easy to binge.\n\nThe atmosphere was also done well because the setting of the mansion created a sense of mystery where you just knew something was off. Learning about the different dynamics and drama of the McTavish family was fascinating and I like how the author used certain characters to contrast against each other to show who genuinely had good morals vs. those who did not.\n\nThere were many twists and while some were not a huge shock, I did find that others were more well done where it caught me off guard!\n\nOverall, I thought this was a pretty solid thriller and if you love ones that you can read in a single sitting, you will want to check this out when it releases tomorrow 1/9! Thank you @stmartinspress for the gifted digital copy!\n\nRating 4/5", "total_engagement": 10, "engagement_rate": 0.0007719027402547279, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2024-01-09T00:12:56.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "camden", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ruby mctavish", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "stories", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "families", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thriller", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "jules", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rachel hawkins", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "favorite", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "stmartinspress"}], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9692395925521851}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132616361670, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-18T01:54:13.229Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-18T01:54:13.229Z"}, {"id": 607775132616361669, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "766192455", "created_at": "2024-01-18T01:54:13.224Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-18T01:54:13.224Z"}, {"id": 607775132616479591, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-18T03:30:34.966Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-25T03:37:54.850Z"}, {"id": 607775132616479592, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2024-01-18T03:30:34.972Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-25T03:37:54.855Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": null, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/a_pucking_bibliophile", "post_id": "0580b59e-e195-4ad3-93f0-56dafc1c2bcb", "program_id": null, "location": null, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/BioMatch_placeholder_v2.jpg", "phash": null, "image_entities": null, "phash_property": null}], "post_text": "\ud83d\udccd San Francisco Bay Area\nBook nerd \ud83d\udcda\nHockey fanatic \ud83c\udfd2", "total_engagement": null, "engagement_rate": null, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2024-01-15T07:11:20.000Z", "brands": null, "text_entities": null, "hashtags": null, "mentions": null, "categories": null, "post_properties": null}]}
