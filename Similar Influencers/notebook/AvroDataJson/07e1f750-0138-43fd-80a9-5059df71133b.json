The battlefield symbolizes chaos & confusion of life. As the world becomes increasingly chaotic & confusing, & as our mental health gets challenged just like Arjuna\u2019s, I feel its message is more relevant now than ever before\n\n2)\u00a0It takes into account different mindsets & attitudes\n\nIt is not a one-size-fits-all scripture. It accepts that individuals are different, with varied mindsets, attitudes and beliefs, dictated by predominance of Gunas in their personality. In this sense Bhagavad Gita is empathetic & speaks directly to each one of us\n\n3)\u00a0It provides various modalities that can be tailored to different mindsets\n\nIt seeks to answer the problem of suffering, & provides a variety of solutions keeping in mind the varied mindsets humans have.

There\u2019s so much \u2018Ego\u2019 anxiety in Yoga world, that I\u2019ve met many who unknowingly end up rejecting their current state of self, labeling it as (bad) \u2018Ego\u2019, to desperately seek some (good) \u2018True Self\u2019 out there, somewhere. Such self-rejection births Spiritual Bypassing & I\u2019ve often been told by Yoga skeptics that Yoga encourages spiritual bypassing\n\nBeyond its popular understanding as self-conceit, \u2018Ego\u2019 is nothing but the \u201cI\u201d or the self of a person. It's neither good nor bad. Rejecting, hating, or denying the self by labeling it as bad \u2018Ego\u2019 creates an inner division that is constantly at war with itself\n\nIn last night\u2019s panel discussion on Bhagavad Gita, I spoke about this very topic\n\nYoga is deeply rooted in acceptance of how & where one is. The entire 1st\u00a0& start of 2nd\u00a0chapter of Gita details Arjuna\u2019s dismal mental state. If Yogic tradition wanted us to look away or deny present reality, then such incidents wouldn\u2019t have been stated\n\nArjuna neither rejects his confused state, which could have been spiritual bypassing, nor does he fake a positive stance, which could be seen as toxic positivity. He is neither embarrassed by his sorry state, nor does he feel shy in front of his Guru & friend Krishna. Arjuna embraces his \u2018Ego\u2019 totally, & in this totality he is humbled to seek the counsel of Krishna\n\nIn Itihasa - Purana (the epics) one finds many brave men & women, including Gods like Rama & Krishna, going through their own challenges with complete acceptance of their current state of self. Even Bhakti tradition is full of incidents of sadness, suffering, guilt, regret, the so-called, \u2018shadow emotions\u2019\n\nThere can be no transformation in denial. If one rejects current state of self, as bad \u2018Ego\u2019, then one is rejecting self-transformation itself, cuz\u2019 there can be no transformation without recognition & acceptance of the self (lower self)\n\nYoga is a path of accepting the current, limited self, & realizing the True-Self hidden within it. A blanket rejection of the limited self as 'bad Ego' will only cause division & anxiety\n\nRelax, embrace your current state of self, the 'Ego', & transform mindfully, with empathy & faith", "total_engagement": 846, "engagement_rate": 0.02324111974945743, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-04T13:55:04.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "&", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "men & women", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "state", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "anxiety", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ego", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "flak", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ego &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "self", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "guru & friend", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "stance", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rama & krishna", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bypassing & i", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "1st & start", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "world", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lot", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "many", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "division", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nothing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "krishna", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328836108, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:14.733Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:14.733Z"}, {"id": 607775132328836107, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "98088755", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:14.729Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:14.729Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510531, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:23.331Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:02.963Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510532, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:23.335Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:02.979Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175093627490, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ClyQjXJvCxx/", "post_id": "2986522301685312625", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "I love hugs, giving & receiving. I've often wondered, what if all philosophies & practices of Yoga that we try (struggle) to engage with lead to an embrace, a warm comforting hug? \n\nWhat if all our spiritual pursuits, challenges & stresses end in a cuddle, a gentle loving cuddle? Beyond terse philosophies & rigid notions of spirituality, what if it all is just a big sigh, a deep rest of sorts in the comforting  arms of the Divine? My Yoga is making me sink deeper in to those arms, more n' more..\n\nSo many mystics, across cultures have expressed their highest spiritual state as a loving embrace from the Divine. The 13th century Yogi Saint, Sant Jnaneshwar expresses his most profound spiritual experience as \u201cshevati vishwarupe mithi det Hari\u201d, meaning, at the end I was embraced by the universal Lord Hari\u201d. Then, we have the 17th century mystic, Saint Tukaram exclaiming lovingly his spiritual enlightenment as \u201cprem rase baisali mithi\u201d, a cuddle filled with nectar of Love\n\nOn the other side of the world, we have the Christian mystic, Saint Angela of Foligno of the 13th century, presenting her enlightenment as \u201cThe embrace of God that produces a light so great that the soul understands the fullness of God's goodness, which it experiences in itself\u201d. Or, the Sufi mystic, Jalalludin Rumi, expressing his unconditional love for the beloved by saying \u201cIn the orchard and rose garden, I see your face. In the shadows of passion, I am embraced by your love\u201d\n\nTruly, a Bhakta (devotee) doesn't care for transcendental experiences. The devotee, in their love for the Divine, manifests the profundity of enlightenment in the here & now. There is nowhere to go & no place to reach for the Bhakta. While philosophers argue & the skeptics debate about what it is & how it is, the Bhakta experiences it right in the heart through total surrender & unashamed love of the beloved Divine. Divinity is always embracing us, we just have to acknowledge it & melt in it.

He is the primary deity of most renunciate ascetics, Yogis & Sadhus. This \u2018teacher of teachers\u2019 is so important that even the incarnating Gods go to him for knowledge\n\nHe cannot be understood as a concept, only as consciousness. One can only cognize him by becoming him. He is the original anti-authority of Yogic culture, taking all concepts & turning them on their head for us to emerge out of our minds. As a principle, he is the Avadhoot of Tantrics, the Aulia of Sufis, the holy-fool of Christians & the crazy oracle elder of the indigenous tribes of the world\n\nHe makes the seeker challenge norms, breaks their mindset & unwrap what lies within. Only beyond mind does his domain begin, if you can get there through self-effort & grace, you are welcome, or else, find yourself someone else\n\nHe is a strict disciplinarian, yet his love is as tender as that of a mother\u2019s hug. He does not molly-coddle, yet his is the most secure lap to rest your head-on. He topples every ladder, he demolishes every structure that emerges from the recesses of mental constructs, that\u2019s how he works. Words, language, scriptures & holy books squirm at his feet for he is beyond any tangible expression. He is represented as a wanderer ascetic yet he is the stable foundation of Yogic knowledge system. He is only accessible through Tapas, no non-sense view of life, sharp intellect & naked devotion of a loving heart\n\nHe inspires through perplexing ways, he teaches with the strictest of discipline, he guides with a keen eye of a parent and he supports with unconditional love. In this sense, he truly is the Guru of the Gurus\n\nWhere will you find him?, only in your heart. How will you reach him? only by strongest of Vairagya - dropping all that you are not. Silence is his expression, solitude is his abode. He is never in the grey, yet you find him when you go beyond the black and white\n\nMy salutations to Datta Guru, today & always.

Yes! I am truly enjoying watching this body age. Like a curious child I am amazed at how the body complains at efforts that it once managed with youthful zest. It\u2019s quite an eye-opener to notice how hard it is to drop body-fat now as compared to my competitive bodybuilding days. I chuckle at the fact that I can\u2019t manage activities & effort that were a breeze just a decade ago. I enthusiastically wait to regrow my beard every few months just to be surprised by the growing number of grey hair, &, above all, the gradually receding hairline, the ever growing crows feet, the sagging skin, the faintly crackling joints, they all have become my besties now. I deeply appreciate how my ageing body has made me value it even more & made me disciplined towards maintaining what I consider my physical \u2018home\u2019 for now\u2026\n\nIn Hatha Yogic terms the body is addressed as a Ghata, a baked clay pot. The pot is said to \u2018house\u2019 contents only for a certain time period. For me, it\u2019s beautiful to see how life entered this pot some decades ago, how life is \u2018life-ing\u2019 itself through the years, & how the pot endures on despite the bruises & batterings.\n\nIn due course, a day will come when this pot will crack & the life within it will be released. Then, life will \u2018life\u2019 itself someplace else - in another residence. I await with curiosity to go through that beautiful process of Death,  the time when this pot will eventually break. Life will go on, repeatedly housing itself in temporary accomodations that are beyond my idea of I, me & myself, & even beyond my concept of 'my body'.\n\nSo sacred is this ritual of Life n' Death for me that being alive has itself become my prayer. \n\nWe all are ageing, willingly or unwillingly.

Though the scriptures give various schemas, they often come across as vague.

If one ends up analyzing oneself, there is a chance of subjective bias (both negative & positive bias).\n\nIn spite of the above limitations, here is a simple 4C scale of Yogic self-assessment that I usually prescribe.

A decade ago, I too suffered from Social Media burnout, since then I decided on the following\n\nI am often asked what\u2019s my Social Media Strategy. Well, I don\u2019t have any. Instead of Strategy, I choose to focus on Clarity. Sharing my clarity here, feel free to use the tips in your context\n\nNumber 1: Clarity\nI do not consider Social Media to be evil. It\u2019s like any other resource that needs to be regulated. So, be clear about why you are on it. The more clarity you have, the lesser the overwhelm & time waste\n\nNumber 2: Limiting Usage\nUnbridled usage can drain you. This is why clarity matters. Once you have clarity, the next step is limiting usage of Platforms & Time. In my case, I am active only on Facebook & Instagram. I do not do Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok or even WhatsApp. Limiting my usage has cost me a lot of friends & also a lot of work/business, but I am fine with sacrificing that for my sanity. I also do not use it for a few months a year when I am away for my yearly silence\n\nNumber 3: Education\nI use Social Media as an education tool primarily for 3 of my main educational interests\na)\u00a0Exercise Sciences\nb)\u00a0Finance & Economics\nc)\u00a0Interior Designing\n\nNumber 4: Expression\nFor me, Social Media is a tool of expression. I express my joys, sorrows, happiness, traumas & my Yogic learnings through my posts. I especially focus on my Yogic journey in hope that my sharing helps others\n\nNumber 5: Promotion\nSocial Media helps me promote my work. Learning to do this has been a journey in itself, but now I am comfortable. I know many find this part daunting \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 but I want to assure you, if you keep up with it, one day it won\u2019t feel as tough\n\nNumber 6: Distraction\nI use it as entertainment & distraction.

post is not to undermine popular modalities but to give a broader view of diverse traditional Yogic practices that have existed for hundreds of years\n\nIn modern times, Yoga is so closely identified with \u0101sana-pr\u0101nay\u0101ma that its impossible to even imagine Yoga without them.The \u2018\u0101sanization\u2019 of Yoga & physicalization of Yogic practices is a fairly recent turn in Yogic history \n\nIt might come as a surprise to many that even today most Indians practice Yoga (knowingly or unknowingly) without even doing \u0101sana or pran\u0101y\u0101ma \n\nTraditionally, \u0101sana-pr\u0101nayama were modalities used primarily by renunciate monks to calm the mind & bring it to a state of sam\u0101dhi. But, spiritual aspirants who were not monks & lived in a family unit as house-holders (grihastha) have used other modalities that served the same purpose \n\nI have seen my mom do her s\u0101dhan\u0101 every single day without fail. Each day she would read her scripture (sw\u0101dhy\u0101ya), chant her mantra (japa) & pray devotedly at a specific time. My dad, who was not so religious, would neither do scripture reading nor chanting, but I never saw him miss his japa-meditation, which he would dedicatedly do twice a day. I am sure those who come from Indian households too have witnessed such scenes at home, right ? \n\nIf you go to smaller towns in India, you see people of all ages sit around a tree & do bhajan (devotional singing) or p\u0101\u021bha (group scripture reading) every evening. Every morning one can see devotees go to their respective temples with flowers, or to the river for holy dip & do \u2018Sun Salutation\u2019 \u2013 mantra prayer to the Sun (not the physical exercise). \n\nMost families (house-holders) will light a lamp at their home altar at sundown & do prayer (\u0101rati) & charity (d\u0101na) like feeding people or animals everyday. Then, there are weekly/yearly pilgrimages (y\u0101tr\u0101), & community talks (pravachan) etc. These practices work on the practitioners gradually over the years serving exactly the same purpose as \u0101sana & pr\u0101n\u0101y\u0101ma does for monks\n\nWhy am I saying all this? Because our definition of Yoga practice guides our growth in Yoga. If our definition of Yoga is narrow, our transformation through Yoga too will be partial", "total_engagement": 7265, "engagement_rate": 0.19958242905414686, "network_type": "instagram",

on our wants & habits\n\u00a0\nWhen Amol Ghag & I went to Sivananda Ashram to do Teacher Training some 20 years ago, we had an interesting experience. During registration, we saw many non-Indians (foreigners) carrying odd type of mats. We had gone to the Teacher Training without a Yoga Mat (can you imagine!!\ud83d\ude00) because we didn\u2019t have a concept of Yoga Mat back then. We had no clue what others were carrying. It didn\u2019t look like usual sports mat that we knew of. On enquiring we got a stare down from the receptionist who said, \"What, you didn\u2019t bring Yoga mat?\" \n\u00a0\nWe rushed to Trivendrum city from the forest ashram & managed to buy something that came closest to a \u2018Yoga Mat\u2019. I paid 75 Rupees (US$1) for it back then. Thus drumrolled the Yoga Mat in my life. It has been the only Yoga Mat I have bought till date\n\u00a0\nI had never used what we know as Yoga mat till then. We used bare floor or handwoven straw mat called chat\u0101i for asana & meditation practice. It was comfortable, basic, & enough. Even today, for my asana, pranayama & dhyana practice at home I use bare floor or a folded cloth mat.Traditionally, those were the things Yoga practitioners have used & many still do\n\u00a0\nI am definitely not hinting at not using a mat, it is a personal choice & its usage depends on the weather etc. I am also not against spiritual merchandise. I understand how & why retail has become an essential component of Yoga Business Model now\n\nBut, how much is too much & how much to feed our psychological vaccuum with material stuff to feel 'spiritual', needs to be thoroughly examined. At times advertorial provocations make us believe that a range of merchandise is essential to grow spiritually. Social Media too triggers our FOMO & competitiveness. Yes, some items do help but they are incidental, the core component is self-motivation. Without self-motivation spiritual merchandise becomes just another external dependence. So, don\"t let means become an end\n\u00a0\nRemember, Bodhi Tree didn\u2019t make a Buddha out of Siddharta Gautam, his determination & sincerity did\n\nTruly, we need very little to realize lasting peace & that peace is not in material stuff", "total_engagement": 1989, "engagement_rate": 0.05464135600670311, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-23T15:35:41.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "&", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "wants & habits", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "amol ghag & i", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "many", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "chat\u0101i", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "registration", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "asana & meditation practice", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "much &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sivananda ashram", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ashram &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& why", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "foreigners", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga mat", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "choice &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "basic", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "receptionist", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "invitation", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "asana pranayama & dhyana practice", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fomo & competitiveness", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "experience", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "type", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Beauty & Fitness", "confidence": 0.9542245268821716}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328836422, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:17.392Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:17.392Z"}, {"id": 607775132328836417, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1057448813", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:17.384Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:17.384Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510555, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:23.726Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:03.404Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510556, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:23.731Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:03.419Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175107493955, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CmidiDUPS3R/", "post_id": "3000090185153981905", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "As a lover of Christ, Christmas is close to my heart. Have been celebrating it at home since I was a kid, thanks to my mother\u2019s enthusiasm. Sharing 3 qualities of Christ that inspire me deeply\n\n1) Jesus Loved: Mark 10:21 says when Jesus looked at a young rich man, he loved him.This was Jesus\u2019 attitude towards all (unless he had some specific lesson to deliver). Jesus loved his followers tenderly. The stories of Martha, Mary, Lazarus warms my heart & makes me tear up every time I read the Bible. [Ref for study, John 11.3,5,11,36]. Jesus loved not only his friends but his enemies too \u2013 this was the power of his unconditional Love. The 3 Johannine texts, John 3:16, 13:1 & 13:34 make it clear. For me this power of unconditional Love is a huge source of inspiration\n\n2) Jesus Respected their Freedom: In the ways of a true teacher, Jesus did not force his opinions on others, he respected their freedom to agree & disagree. Yet, he is hopeful & says, \u201cYou will know the truth & the truth will make you free\u201d (John 8:32). If they disagreed, he was sharp & objective enough to justify his side of argument along with citations & demonstrations. He does not over-simplify the path but gives honest insight & says \"This teaching is difficult, who can accept it?\". When many of his disciples start turning their back on him, he asks the others \u201cDo you also wish to go away?\u201d (John 6:67).This reminds me of Shri Krishna\u2019s advice to Arjuna at the end of the Gita where he tells Arjuna to do what he feels is right. Spiritual pursuit indeed demands whole hearted commitment to the path\u00a0 \n\n3) He Challenged Them: Spiritual guides like Jesus challenge listeners eg: Mark 19:17, Luke 18:18. Opening to our own inner light is difficult, requires ruthless changes. Jesus challenges the mind-set of his listeners & asks them to change their ways, to go & sin no more (John 5:14), to wash each other\u2019s feet (Mark 3:4), to love one\u2019s enemies (Luke 6:27) & to serve God rather than wealth (Luke 16:13). No true spiritual growth can happen without going through the hardships of challenging & surmounting our limiting mind-set\n\nMay this Christmas bring cheer to the world beyond our mutual divisions & discomforts", "total_engagement": 512, "engagement_rate": 0.014065547649789841, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-24T05:10:41.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands":

But life of Christ is one of the biggest example of rejection. It was this rejection that prompted Jesus to remark \u201ca prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, & in his own house\u201d \u2013 Matthew 13:57\n\nIncidentally, all episodes of rejection culminate at the end of Jesus\u2019 mortal life into one of his greatest teaching, the teaching of forgiveness\n\nForgiveness is the other side of Love. Love & forgiveness go hand in hand. Life of Christ shows that love of God resides in our Being & expresses itself through forgiveness \n\nOur life is mired by experiences of resentment. Bitter experiences of past have power to stir our present. Resentment multiplies when held close.The solution to this is forgiveness\n\nMany times we do not even know that we have the power & capacity to forgive. But the power to forgive is one of the strongest powers we have. This power has the capacity to lighten the burden of past\n\nThe power of forgiveness is not just for forgiving others but also for reconciling with our selves. We have a habit of holding a lot of self regret & guilt which manifest as self punishment. Remember, we have the power to forgive ourselves too & start anew without the baggage of past\n\nChrist\u2019s own life & death was a great example of forgiveness. After being rebuked, scourged, ridiculed, spat upon, beaten & cruelly crucified, Jesus still had the capacity & resilience to forgive those who subjected him to such heinous treatment. The immortal words \u201cFather, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing\u201d still guides many to work on forgiveness\n\nForgiveness is empowering not only for oneself but also for the other. When you forgive, the karmic bond binding the two losens up\n\nIf somewhere in the corner of your mind you feel a need to forgive or even ask for forgiveness, be brave & do it. Let this Christmas be the start of a reconciliation process with those who we hold grudges against, & that includes ourselves\n\nLet us forgive, forgive lovingly & openly. Forgive others & above all, forgive ourselves\n\nPic: Me, lighting a candle & seeking forgiveness at The Church of Nativity, Bethlehem, in 2013", "total_engagement": 896, "engagement_rate": 0.02461470838713222, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-25T09:27:43.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "love", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "example", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "being &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "jesus", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& forgiveness", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "honour", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "life & death", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "prophet", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "forgiveness", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "solution", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "house", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lot", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "capacity & resilience", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "beaten", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& guilt", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "power & capacity", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "self regret", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "power", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "country &", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Family & Relationships", "confidence": 0.9830492734909058}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328836584, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:18.199Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:18.199Z"}, {"id": 607775132328836581, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-123223983", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:18.190Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:18.190Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510561, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:23.807Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:03.507Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510562, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:23.812Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:03.531Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175107493877, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CmnMHjiIvFq/", "post_id": "3001420972413874538", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "It\u2019s that time of year when we rush to make New Year Resolutions. It\u2019s good to have goals and pursue them, but we need to be aware of a few things here\n\nFor decades I used to make New Year resolutions out of a sense of inner lack. My low self-esteem would unconsciously compel me to raise bench-marks so high that they would be beyond my reach. The lesser I felt about myself, the higher the bench mark would be. I would strive hard, give it all that I had got, but would either exhaust myself or inadvertently give up and fall into the puddle of guilt and resentment. Every New Year Resolution would thus result in lowering my confidence and my sense of inner lack would sink further\n\nUsing the wisdom of Yoga philosophy helped a lot to resolve this issue. I learned the secret of Small Steps \u2013 to create goals not to fill the inner void of low self-esteem but for the sheer joy of experiencing a newer dimension of myself\n\nHere are some realizations and reflections that have helped me, hope they help those who are in similar situation\n\n1) When I would catch myself rushing to set new goals, I would ask myself, \u2018What\u2019s the rush?\u2019. This would help me pause, reflect on my impulsiveness and be patient \n\n2) Don\u2019t do what you don\u2019t enjoy. If you have to do it anyway, learn to enjoy it, or be clear about that fact that you have to do it even though you dont enjoy it\n\n3) Before setting goals be very, very objective about your circumstances and capabilities. Be realistic and deeply reflect on the impulse and sense of lack that\u2019s making you set goals. Your goals should be \u2018your's\u2019, they should neither be compelled by social trends nor be pushed by peer pressure, especially stuff of social media\n\n4) Realize that you cannot achieve everything all the time, there is no need to have everything or please everyone. You don\u2019t have to be perfect, you just have to be your self\n\n5) Above all, remember that every long journey is made up of smaller steps. You can realize lofty goals by breaking them into smaller parts and pursuing them joyfully without anxiety\n\nTake it easy, easy does it\n\nBig reasssuring hugs to all who are going through a hard time this season \u2764\ufe0f\n\nShare this with friends", "total_engagement": 1992, "engagement_rate": 0.0547237713249636, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-26T01:14:43.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "sense", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reach", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lack", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goals", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "resolutions", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rush", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328836621, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:18.397Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:18.397Z"}, {"id": 607775132328836620, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1178742246", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:18.390Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:18.390Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510563, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:23.842Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:03.572Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510564, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:23.847Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:03.583Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175125220308, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CmrT0dgDQ2T/", "post_id": "3002580744545308051", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": ".\n8 Scriptures every Yoga Student must study\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd\n\n1)\u00a0Bhagavad Gita with Shankara Bhashya\n2)\u00a0Sankhya Karika of Ishvara Krishna with Kaumudi of Vachaspati Mishra\n3)\u00a0Yoga Sutra with Vyasa Bhashya\n4)\u00a0Dasbodh of Samartha Ramdas\n5) Tarka Sangraha of Annamabhatta with the Deepika\n6)\u00a0Sarvadarshana Sangraha of Madhava Acharya\n7) Vivekachudamani of Adi Shankara Acharya\n8)\u00a0Tantraloka of Abhinava Gupta\n\nOf course, this is not an exhaustive list.

They need to be studied, not just read\n\nThe 15-year time frame is my generous guestimate if one studies diligently every day. It could also take more time. Also, study of scriptures is never a one time study, revisions are a must\n \nIf your mind goes - what?? so much time? 15 years?? then, please reflect on how the mind is in a hurry to accumulate knowledge\n\nKnowledge transfer in Indic spirituality happens patiently & experientially. Also, 15 years is not much when you realize that scripture study (Swadhayaya) is a life-long endeavour, to be carried on until the subject matter is realized within fully\n\nIf an intellectual study is not followed through with Sadhana, one becomes like the Donkey, as mentioned in Sushruta Samhita (an important Ayurvedic text) which says, \n\n\u201cthe actions of a person who has studied scriptures without making clear exposition of them are useless like the efforts of a donkey that carries a load of sandalwood without ever being able to enjoy its pleasing scent\u201d\n\nGive yourself next 2 decades to study these texts deeply under the tutelage of teacher/teachers, & live the philosophies & methodologies through your life & your Sadhana\n\nLive a little lighter in the mind & leave the world a little better than what you came into - your Swadhayaya will help you do that", "total_engagement": 1721, "engagement_rate": 0.047278920908766245, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-27T15:38:59.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "ishvara krishna", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "intellectually", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "list", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "karika", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bhagavad gita", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "texts", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga student", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga student", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "documents", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mind", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "books", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "study", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sadhanalive", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& spirituallyremember", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "patiently &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328836655, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:18.644Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:18.644Z"}, {"id": 607775132328836654, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-2016269422", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:18.632Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:18.632Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510565, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:23.878Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:03.612Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510566, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:23.884Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:03.621Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175125220307, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CmuJD97PXYW/", "post_id": "3003377856571864598", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "A few years ago, after my workshop in Belgium, one participant approached me looking visibly confident and radiant. \n\nHe said, \n\"I stopped doing Yoga 10 years ago because I had an injury while doing postures.

Such correlation would be too simplistic to grant ourselves the title of a Yogini (or Yogi). Sharing something specific (but in a simplified way) about what a \u2018Yogini\u2019 is in Indic tradition\n\nYoginis are common to Hindu, Buddhist & Jaina traditions. It\u2019s an honorific bestowed upon women Yoga (Tantra) practitioners by a traditional lineage after achieving a certain state of spiritual mastery. It\u2019s also a name for girls, but that\u2019s not the point here\n\nYoginis extend across spectrum \u2013 from advance practitioners in physical body, to elevated masters optionally in it (not necessarily a human body) & ones that are demi-goddesses/goddesses\n\nAll 3 have supernatural powers (Siddhi) to manipulate 5 elements. They are guardians of secret teachings & disseminate spiritual/mystical knowledge according to level of the seeker. They are known to be fierce teachers, disciplinarians, very hard to please & mostly perceived as sorceresses (esp. as Dakini). Propitiating them requires mature levels of detachment (vairagya) & sacrifice (tapas). Tales of wrath of Yoginis are common in many secret (guhya) Tantra Yoga sects (kula). Depending on sadhaka\u2019s spiritual level, Yoginis manifest as objective or subjective phenomena. At times they (as Dakinis) literally handhold a sadhaka through advance levels of spiritual practices (esp. pranayama) by guiding movements of their inner geography, throwing challenging circumstances at them or facilitating teacher-student meetings in dream or awakened state\n\nIn Hindu Goddess worship, Yoginis are attendants of Durga, & also her warrioresses. Shivapurana describes how Yoginis fiercely attacked King Daksha after Sati sacrificed herself. 64 Yoginis also are experts at 64 Kal\u0101s (skills), esp. alchemy (Ras\u0101yanavidya).

Its not easy for me to make friends or even start conversations. I prefer my own company & truly enjoy it. So, somewhere around February, I decided to put myself out there through my Instagram Posts to challenge my reclusiveness. In return I've received so much love that I can't even express. Thank You \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\n\n2022 was my year of inviting my readers to reflect & deeply introspect on Yoga & their own ideas & perceptions. Introspections can be unsettling. I seek your forgiveness if my tone has caused distress to you. In 2023 too I will continue the call to reflect & instrospect, but with an endeavour to simplify the complex & diverse Yogic teachings. Lets see where I get with this project \n\nOnce again, thank you all who have walked with me & supported me during this challenging period. Your support means a lot to me.\n\nPersonally, 2022 has taught me to cherish those around me, value what I have, & move through life slowly, simply, joyfully & faithfully.\n\nWith this realization I seek to venture into 2023 with a little more effortlessness & surrender\n\nThank You, once again \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd \n\nI wish you a happy, effortless & loving 2023 \u2665\ufe0f",

of Yoga where Yoga is uprooted from its core philosophies & practiced as isolated modalities, as opposed to being practiced as a wholistic knowledge system that is lived through life.\n\nThis is why we see so many Yogic practices done haphazardly in the popular Yoga culture without much clarity on why they are actually done. Yoga teachers know how practitioners are more inclined towards doing rather than knowing. This is also why practices that have little to do with Yoga are passed off as Yoga in popular culture. It\u2019s as if we are so caught up with the \u2018how\u2019 that we have forgotten the \u2018why\u2019.\n\nThe solution to this is to teach Yoga not merely as a set of isolated practices but as a holistic system of transformation based on a clear philosophical premise, a well-defined goal & a steady hierarchy of practices that help the practitioner reach the set goal.\u00a0\n\nThe responsibility of educating the students about Yoga in this manner lies completely upon the Yoga teacher.", "total_engagement": 2169, "engagement_rate": 0.05958627510233235, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-17T13:12:27.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "practices", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "collection", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "term", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "narrative", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "set", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goal & a", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "philosophies &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& decontextualization of yoga", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Beauty & Fitness", "confidence": 0.9975307583808899}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328836723, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:19.512Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:19.512Z"}, {"id": 607775132328836722, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1191270334", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:19.483Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:19.483Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510573, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.041Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:03.770Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510574, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.048Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:03.777Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175132382252, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CnjtuMTvEjH/", "post_id": "3018457261673302215", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "Svadhyaya means personal study & introspection of Yogic texts.Traditionally, it entails studying sacred texts, reading, reciting, reflecting & applying. It also means meditation & reflection on self. By self study one studies the self \n\nSvadhyaya is one of the most essential aspects of a Yoga practitioner\u2019s life, after Sadhana. It is NOT a haphazard reading of books, frenzied gathering of knowledge, or anxious retention of information out of FOMO. Svadhyaya is always systematic, meticulous & stems from a sincere desire to understand life & self \n\nWhy is theoretical study important in Yoga ? \nThat\u2019s because the Yoga process often tests us through tricky life challenges. This tends to create self-doubt & shake our trust in the path. A diligent theoretical study keeps us assured that we are on the right track & anchors our confidence in knowing that the path we are on has been tried & tested since thousands of years by millions of Yogis \n\nThis assurance is essential, without which one keeps jumping from one modality to other in self-doubt, ultimately becoming a modality junkie \n\nSvadhyaya has more to do with assurance of the Heart than intellectuality of the Mind \n\nI've seen many reject theoritical study of Yoga by claiming Yoga to be all about experience. Here, Svadhyaya is analogous to driving. Even though driving is all about the hands-on experience we need basic theoretical knowledge of signals, highway codes & machine mechanics that aid navigating roads safely & help ourselves in case of automobile break-down. This is exactly how theoretical study, Svadhyaya, works \u2013 it helps us navigate spiritual path & gives us faith to rise when we fall or doubt.

What we see, and what we hear constantly, creates a popular narrative. The popular narrative tends to become a dominant idea, especially when social media dominates how we consume information. \u00a0\n\nThere being no filter or fact-check, at least for the Yoga industry, whatever is popular tends to be considered sacrosanct. \n\nPopularity doesn\u2019t always connote authenticity. These days, whatever feeds demand and keeps the revenue stream flowing is emphasized by the Algorithm. Such selective emphasis on ideas, without examination of their authenticity, tends to create a lop-sided discourse, often perpetuating a bandwagon effect. A bandwagon effect is based on the assumption that whatever is popular is right & therefore one should adopt certain ideas & behaviors simply because others are doing so.\n\nThe way we understand Yoga today is heavily influenced by social media narratives that may not always be based on history, facts, or evidence. What is popular & trending tends to become a dominant industry discourse, becoming the actual voice of the stakeholders, gradually building a Yogic culture that stands independent from its original intention & ethos.\n\nMy note is not necessarily a critique, but an invitation to reflect.

I too have mentioned the importance of studying with \u2018your\u2019 teacher. Lots can be said, probably I will write a Blog, but for now here are some clarifications & tips\n\nYoga is not a Do-It-Yourself project. Yes, one can learn from internet & books initially, but a time comes when all that knowledge needs to be personalized. As one matures on the Yoga path, the study is undertaken not for intellectual curiosity but for inner exploration.This is where one needs guidance of a teacher, \u2018your\u2019 teacher. This is a very important step on Yoga path\n\nWhen I say \u2018your\u2019 teacher, I mean a teacher who you can study with, over a long period of time, with reverence, dedication & trust. The term \u2018your\u2019 entails a mutually recognized teacher-student relation\n\nHow to find \u2018your\u2019 teacher-\n\n1)\u00a0First, deeply reflect on what subject matter or dimension of Yoga interests you. This requires clarity cuz' we live in times where there is too much on offer, enough to confuse anyone. So, finding clarity in what one wants to study is a good first step\n\n2)\u00a0Then, start looking for teacher/s that can teach & guide you on that subject. This will be like finding a needle in a haystack\n\n3)\u00a0This process is refined by trial & error. You will have to approach different teachers & experience their teachings, till you find specific one/s that give you whats needed & you feel connected with. This too will be a process of filtration, at times misleading, not always a happy one, but it will refine your search nevertheless \u00a0\n\n4)\u00a0Gradually, by process of elimination, you will end up with one or a couple of teachers with whom you will want to study consistently. This clarity will help you create a dedicated relationship. The reason why I have mentioned one or two teachers max is that by the time one reaches this stage, one has filtered through the overwhelm of wanting to study multiple things. One is content with a single or a few teachers to learn specific things\n\n5)\u00a0Once you find such teacher/s, commit to them wholeheartedly with dedication, trust, reverence & humility\n\n6)\u00a0Note: Your teacher may or may not be your spiritual Guru.

I understand many may not have had comfortable experiences with an idea of \u2018God\u2019 &/or institutions of \u2018God\u2019 (organized religion) & therefore it's natural that they project their anxieties or views on Yogic spirituality\n\nBut, 'God' is a fluid concept in Indic spirituality. Theres no single, specific idea of \u2018God\u2019 in Yogic knowledge systems. Followers of opposing views of \u2018God\u2019 have thrived side by side in India over millennia. Even Gita allows for this freedom of interpretation, Krishna says in 4:11, \u201cHowsoever they seek Me, even so, do I approach them. All follow My path in every way\u201d\n\nThis is because Yoga is primarily a pursuit of absolute Truth (Sat), not necessarily a pursuit of \u2018God\u2019. But, this Truth takes the form of \u2018God\u2019/\u2018Gods\u2019. Thus, Yoga can be a pursuit of Truth and/or of \u2018God\u2019, for they are not different or separate\n\nTraditionally, the view of \u2018God\u2019 depends on Yogic ideology one aligns with. Here are some diverse ideas across Veda & Tantra. One can choose any to grow spiritually, for it\u2019s not about who one worships, but how the worship transforms the seeker\n\n\u2022 Theism (Bhakti lineages)\n\n\u2022 Polytheism (Hindus worship many deities)\n\n\u2022 Monotheism (Vaishnava, Shaiva lineages)\n\n\u2022 A-theism (Sankhya, advaita Vedanta, Bauddha, Jaina)\n\n\u2022 Pantheism (Vedic Gods permeate universe/nature\u2013 Goddess Ushas, Sun God, Surya Dev)\n\n\u2022 Divine as human (Krishna/Saints)\n\n\u2022 Divine without form, as Absolute consciousness (Brahman)\n\n\u00b7\u00a0God as Creator, Sustainer, Destroyer\n\n\u2022 God as one\u2019s own Guru, child, lover, friend, mother, father & also the guest\n\n\u2022 Spiritual illusion too is considered a Goddess (Maya-Shakti)\n\n\u2022 Most importantly, God in each one of us, in hearts of all (says Krishna in Gita)\n\nSo, let ideas of \u2018God\u2019 not stop you from embracing Yoga in its completeness. There are diverse views of Divine in Yoga for all. Even if one doesn't want to prescribe to any view, one's own undeniable existence itself is \u2018God\u2019, the Truth (Sat)\n\nNothing is not Divine, nothing is not \u2018God\u2019, nothing is not \u2018Truth\u2019 in Yoga \u2013 know it, be it", "total_engagement": 1328, "engagement_rate": 0.0364825142166424, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-24T13:52:28.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "practices", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "father &", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "veda & tantra", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "idea", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "truth", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "god", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "religion", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "practitioners", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "experiences", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "many", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "institutions", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Family & Relationships", "confidence": 0.9682748913764954}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328836781, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.067Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.067Z"}, {"id": 607775132328836780, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-195244443", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.065Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.065Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510583, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.245Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:03.927Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510584, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.257Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:03.936Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175143167303, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn2LyrQI4we/", "post_id": "3023656060752989214", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "The other day I saw a sponsored post \u2013 \u201cDo Camel pose to cure back-pain\u201d & knew what to write about \n\nThe human individual is not so simplistic that we make blanket statements like the above. Our individuality is not unidimensional, it is complex, multilayered, interactive & inheres a larger matrix\n\nThat\u2019s why, offering unidimensional, linear solutions to problems needs to be avoided by Yoga Teachers. Such unidimensional solutions are common in the Yoga world\nEg: Migraine? \u2013 Do Headstand\nShortness of breath? \u2013 Do Pranayama\nInsomnia? \u2013 Do Yoga Nidra\n\nI've even heard people make general statements like, \"Just do Yoga, no need to do anything else\"\n\nIts not as simple as saying \u201cDo this pose to cure back pain\u201d because the person\u2019s back pain could have less to do with physical anatomy & more to do with ergonomics, diet, sleep, habits, foot-wear, posture, inactivity, heredity, past-traumas & many other factors\n\nThough, the reason for our unidimensional POV cannot be pegged on a single factor. I believe it is a reflection of our Colonial education system that has upheld a sharp Mind-Body dicotomy (Cartesian dualism) over last 4 centuries\n\u00a0\nTraditional Yoga & Ayurveda sees the world differently though. Its based on a concept called \u201cPinda-Brahmanda Siddhanta\u201d - Micro-Macrocosm Principle, which states that every micro-unit is a part of a macro unit & every macro unit is made of many micro-units. These units are not mutually exclusive but they essentially influence each other. In togetherness, they create a whole system - like the tiny parts of a wrist watch\n\nAn Individual exists simultaneously at multiple dimensions \u2013 physical, mental, social, cultural & spiritual, that constantly interact to keep them alive & thriving\n\nThe micro-unit, i.e individual\u2019s mental state, could create physical chaos, which could, in turn, create a societal crisis. The macro unit,  i.e societal uncertainty (like the Pandemic), could initiate individual insecurities, which can have a dire physical impact\n\nWe can't separate an individual\u2019s micro-macro interactions from societal micro-macro expressions, & V.V\n\nThis Dynamic & Holistic view needs to be kept in mind by Yoga Teachers & Therapists\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd", "total_engagement": 1134, "engagement_rate": 0.03115299030246422, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-25T17:31:52.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "&", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "backpain", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "anatomy & more", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reflection", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "camel", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "problems", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga teachers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "world", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "interactive &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "post", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "cultural & spiritual", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "human individual", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "solutions", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "traditional yoga & ayurveda", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328836787, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.198Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.198Z"}, {"id": 607775132328836786, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1875269740", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.195Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.195Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510585, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.285Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:03.974Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510586, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.292Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:03.980Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175143167295, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn4f2kFvU3q/", "post_id": "3024307238823874026", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "I sincerely believe that if one has even completed their basic \u2018200 Hour Yoga Training\u2019 they have enough transformation techniques to last a lifetime. If the seeker doesn't understand this, then what they need is not more techniques but more trust\n\nBut we live in tricky times, because while Yoga is a path of generating one-pointed focus, we live amongst excess of modalities. New techniques, styles & practices are launched as if going out of fashion, each claiming to offer something new, different, & better. The practitioners, with their restless minds, bored by the same old practice, triggered by FOMO, tend to either get overwhelmed by the sheer number of techniques on offer or keep hopping from one to another without giving their practice enough time to come to fruition\n\nThis is why we need to filter through sales pitches, inquire into our need for more, our FOMO, reflect on our boredom, question our addiction to excitement & simplify our practice\n\nLet\u2019s swelter on the path till we find the teaching & teacher/s that we need, then, single-mindedly let\u2019s pursue the teaching with total commitment, faith & sincerity. This is what Yoga scriptures call an Ek\u0101gra (\u090f\u0915\u093e\u0917\u094d\u0930) Chitta, a one-pointed mind. Its the working goal of all Yogins, without it, there can be no sam\u0101dhi or self-realization \n\nEtymologically, ek\u0101gra means \u2018single-intent\u2019, fixed on one point, undisturbed. Ek\u0101gra is also one of the most refined states of mind that facilitates \u2018Chitta Vritti Nirodha\u2019. According to Patanjali & Vyasa, there can be no Vritti Nirodha without an ek\u0101gra mind\n\nIn the middle of the Gita, Krishna tells Arjuna to make his mind one-pointed (tatraik\u0101gra\u1e43 mana\u1e25k\u1e5btv\u0101). Then, at the end of the Gita, Krishna asks, \u201cO\u2019 Arjun, have you heard Me with an ek\u0101gra mind? Has your ignorance & delusion been destroyed?\u201d This tells us the importance of ek\u0101gra mind for seekers\n\nYogic spirituality is not a path of incessant gathering but a path of refining & lightening. It\u2019s not how much you know but what you do with whatever you know\n\nSo, instead of losing energy in just gathering techniques, trust your practice \u2013 it will lead you within.

Though 'complicated' is a relative term, what I mean is, one doesn't really have to resort to acrobatics or strenuous contortions for asana to work effectively. I believe the \"advance\" of asana is in the ease of doing & depth of attention, not in complicated arrangement of limbs or complexity of effort\n\nYes, the tapasvi sadhu (yogic ascetics) of past did do effortful contortions but their goal was not physical culture or wellness but austerity & penance\n\nIf there is one posture that is effective in its simplicity, its Janu Shirsa asana /Maha Mudra\n\nThis, one leg forward bend is mentioned in some traditional Hatha texts not because its a complicated contortion but because in its simplicity it is effective in pranic modulation\n\nThough i've mentioned advanced effects below, my point is not to trigger impatience but to help us allow the simplicity of an asana to work its magic over time instead of squeezing each asana effortfully always in our practice\n\nPhysically, be on sit bones & bend. If you don't reach foot it\u2019s fine, hold ankles. It\u2019s not about how much you bend but from where you bend (this is important if done as a mudra for kundalini kriya). Don't rush to touch chin to shin or let impatience mess your back. Be gentle, relax in posture & be with steady breath & attention (or breath holds in jalandhar bandha in advance phase). During my anushthaan in 2015, i've even used this mudra effectively as pranic dhyana\n\nPsychologically, this asana/mudra neutralizes opposing mindsets over time. It 'lightens' an emotionally heavy mind. Its calming & rejuvenating if not rushed into & aided by steady breath & attention\n\nThe pose is purposely kept simple in the tradition because in its effortlessness the attention ventures deep into psychological depths\n\nPranically, in initial stages, it ensures balanced functioning of apana & a steady movement of samana vayus. In advance stage, when done as a mudra with prana sankochana (pranic recoil) it also aids in redirection of apana\n\nSo, keep it simple, keep practising & give your practise time to mature\ud83d\ude4f\n\nSource: My venerable teacher, Gheranda Samhita, Hatha & Joga Pradipika", "total_engagement": 2280, "engagement_rate": 0.06263564187797038, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-27T16:23:34.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "culture", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "attention", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ease", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bend", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "posture", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goal", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "arrangement", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "advance", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hatha &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "term", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "asana", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& aided by steady breath &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "samhita", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& be with steady breath & attention", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "simplicity", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "calming & rejuvenating", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "austerity &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sit bones & bend", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "wellness", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "doing & depth", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328836809, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.398Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.398Z"}, {"id": 607775132328836807, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1871754980", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.395Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.395Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510589, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.364Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:04.036Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510590, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.370Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:04.045Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175143167288, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn9Zj0hvja7/", "post_id": "3025686937407993531", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "This memory came up, reminding me of an incident. A few years ago, someone saw pictures from my workshop & asked,\n\n\"Prasad, I've noticed, the people in your Yoga workshops don\u2019t look like Yogis, they all look like ordinary people. What 'style' of Yoga do you actually teach?\"\n\nMy answer was sincere. I replied, \n\"Yes, the participants in my workshops are ordinary people & that\u2019s the \u2018style\u2019 of Yoga I teach, it's called - Yoga for ordinary people.\"\n\nI do not really identify with any 'style of Yoga' because what I have studied & know is Yoga. And, as for the people in my workshops looking ordinary, I cherish it. I am humbled how everytime the participants turn up for the workshops in whatever shape, state or form they may be in, uninhibited, with trust & openness\n\nDear friends, Yoga does not make you extraordinary. In fact, a diligent practice of Yoga makes you realize that you are ordinary, just like everyone else\n\nAny need to feel special, or to be validated as extraordinary is the need of the Ahambh\u0101v - \"ego\"\n\nWhen you use Yogic teachings in its broader sense, for self-understanding, you realize that there\u2019s nothing really special about you, you are ordinary, just like everyone else \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAllow Yoga to help you come down from the complexity of your mind to the simplicity of your being\n\nLife is simple, but our minds become complicated. Constant need to feel extraordinary & fill the inner vaccuum with external validation is one reason why mind becomes complicated\n \nAs a Yoga Educator, I try to educate students to live life in its simplicity & enjoy their ordinary-ness without anxiety & strain of feeling extraordinary\n\nThis is why my posts are often reflective & inquiry driven. Let us all enquire as to how we have unnecesarily complicated our mind & life \n\nThat's my Yoga teaching 'Style', if you will. \ud83d\ude4f\n\nBy the way, here's that picture from my Bangkok workshop in 2019. Look at all the lovely ordinary people in there - big, small, women, men, old, young, wrinkly, taught, bald, hairy, Yoga teachers, first timers, Yoga pants, no Yoga pants \u2013 we all had a great time learning Yoga\n\nLet's normalize ordinariness \u2764\ufe0f\nShare with your ordinary friends \ud83e\udd17", "total_engagement": 1428, "engagement_rate": 0.03922969149199198, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-28T12:46:51.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "someone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "workshops", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "workshop", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "trust & opennessdear", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& strain", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "extraordinary", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "askedprasad", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& know", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "incident", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "participants", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "pictures", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mind & life", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reflective &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "studied", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "enjoy", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "memory", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "style", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yogis", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "simplicity", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Beauty & Fitness", "confidence": 0.9758658409118652}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328836823, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.563Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.563Z"}, {"id": 607775132328836822, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "392476703", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.561Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.561Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510591, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.402Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:04.069Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510592, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.407Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:04.075Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175143167285, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CoAUJZ-v-2w/", "post_id": "3026507556894797232", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "Spoke to a group of 200 hour teacher trainees today as a guest teacher & reminded them that their potential is far, far greater than their self-dobut.\n\nMany times we overthink things that may not actually happen. Our anxiety makes us overthink & exaggerates a tiny stimulus into a monsterous trigger. An anxious mind impulsively reaches outward to grasp material objects thinking that they will provide security.\n\nBut, the world of thoughts & things is infinite & makes the anxious mind even more anxious & overwhelmed. The thirst for more rests on a belief that it will bring lasting peace & happiness, which unfortunately is a lie.\n\nStop investing your energy & attention in overthinking. Slow down, step back, breathe, & allow the anxious buzz of the mind to calm down. Focus your time & energy to calm down that mind instead.\n\nWhen the mind calms down you will know that you are more than the thougt based reality you have concieved for yourself. This is when you stop being a slave to the mind & become the true owner of the mind. This is when you stop living a life of anxious projection & live a life of conscious possibility. This is when lasting inner peace is not only sensed but also embodied.\n\nOur life is an opportunity to make this shift happen. \n\nLife is like a leaf, barely holding on to the branch that it hangs from. Its existence is fragile. When the season changes & the wind blows, the leaf will fall. What will you hang on to when the leaf of your life lets go off the tree of life ?

I asked my elder sister why the teacher had marked my answer on Newton\u2019s\u00a0law wrong when it was correct. Reading my answer, she smiled & said, \u201cPrasad, you can\u2019t make up your own law & call it Newton\u2019s law\u201d. She was right, I had just put together some keywords & made up my own interpretation of Newton\u2019s law which didn't come even close to his original statement\n\nWe often come across subjective interpretations of Yoga that are generalized as Yoga, as in \u201cI feel Yoga is\u2026so, Yoga is\u2026.\u201d, or \u201cI have experienced Yoga as, therefore Yoga is\u2026\u201d. It's like saying, I\u2019ve walked in the forest behind my home, therefore all forests in the world are like my backyard\n\nSuch subjectivism has created so many interpretations of Yoga in popular culture that it\u2019s hard to know what Yoga is anymore\n\nYes, Yoga is a personal experience but generalizing one\u2019s own experience as the definition of Yoga not only creates confusion but also devalues & dilutes the original thought & its cultural context\n\nDoes that mean subjective experience has no value? No, individual experiences are important in Yoga, after all, Yoga happens within, but the interpretations need to happen in context\n\nThroughout Yogic history, the issue of subjectivism was regulated by contextualizing one\u2019s experience (anubhava) with reference to scriptures (sh\u0101stra). Students were taught how to deduct, formulate & defend their statements. In popular Yoga, since we don\u2019t give much weightage to scriptural testimony or scriptural study, it\u2019s a free for all\n\nJust like lawyers don\u2019t create their own laws to defend their clients, or scientists don\u2019t make claims without evidence, we as Yoga professionals too need to responsibly back our claim to avoid confusion created by emotive subjectivism\n\nA decade ago, someone saw my Yoga teacher training post & asked if I would like to use their book on \u201cpoetic interpretation of Yoga Sutra\u201d as a textbook. I was told many YTTs were using it. When I read some pages, I was shocked to find it to be the author\u2019s personal, creative interpretation that had hardly anything to do with Patanjali\u2019s thoughts. I wonder what the students took home as Yoga Sutra..", "total_engagement": 1420, "engagement_rate": 0.03900991730996401, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-31T11:42:19.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "&", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& defend", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "deduct", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "prasad", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "answer", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "formulate", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& dilutes", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "devalues", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga teacher training post &", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thought & its", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sister", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "law", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "school science exam", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "keywords", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "law & call", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teacher", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "experience", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Beauty & Fitness", "confidence": 0.9872385263442993}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328836849, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.953Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.953Z"}, {"id": 607775132328836848, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1957094226", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.951Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:20.951Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510597, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.501Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:04.158Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510598, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.509Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:04.164Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175146538364, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CoIDyjlPg70/", "post_id": "3028687417725816564", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "As modern Yoga aligns more with Anatomical & Therapeutical approach instead of Ontological approach, as mainstream dismisses or side-steps Scriptural teachings as \u2018religious\u2019 or \u2018outdated\u2019 & opts for science-backed research as evidence for Yogic benefits, one wonders if Scripture study is even relevant \n\nTo understand this, one needs to know what Yogic Scriptures are\n\nThe ancient Yogis were \u2018Scientists\u2019 in their own regard, driven by curiosity, inquiry, experimentation, & zest to answer deeper questions of life like any genuine Science enthusiast. They tried to answer fundamental life questions in their own way, by giving their own models & systems of inquiry. But, the aim of their inquiry & experimentation was not exploitation of nature, but elimination of suffering\n\nOne could think of Yogic scriptures as \u2018Scientific Journals\u2019 of Yogi Scientists. Traditionally, there is an elaborate method of assessing the efficacy of Scriptures, akin to stringent norms of today\u2019s peer-reviewed Scientific journals\n\nYoga has been codified & presented in what is called as Sh\u0101stra, which etymologically means the one that saves through its teachings. Adi Shankara, 9 CE, compares Sh\u0101stra to a mother nurturing her child. The Gita (16:24) too says, knowing Scriptures one should elevate themselves & society. There are thousands of scriptures written across Yogic history. These Sh\u0101stras aim to guide, educate & motivate the seeker to facilitate their own psychological liberation\n\nThus, Scriptures are not mere intellectual head scratching but about human self & life, about you & me.

It's fascinating that the symbol for \u201cwave function\u201d in quantum mechanics is \u03a8 (psi) which looks like Trident of Shiva.Incidentally, in Shaiva Tantra philosophy, Shiva is said to manifest in waves (\u092f\u0938\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0947\u0937\u0928\u093f\u092e\u0947\u0937\u093e\u092d\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u091c\u0917\u0924\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0932\u092f\u094b\u0926\u092f\u094c - Spandak\u0101rika).\n\nSome Physicist say fundamental nature of universe is \u2018fields\u2019. Mathematically a field is something that takes value at every point in space. Even the \u2018vacuum\u2019 is not 'nothing' but is made up of \u2018fields\u2019 - throbbing with potentiality. Physics has always reminded me of Tantra Ag\u0101ma & thinking of \u2018fields\u2019 & \u2018waves\u2019 takes me back to mind-blowing works by Tantra Masters like Kall\u0101ta, AbhinavaGupta & Kshemar\u0101ja\n\nFascinatingly, these 'fields' cannot be still, they vibrate in excitation, constantly change in mathematical value & every excitation manifests a particle. The manifested world is excitation states of these fields. I am often tempted to correlate this with \u2018Abhasavada\u2019, the doctrine of appearance in Tantras. Excitations of \u2018fields\u2019 are like threads that connect all objects, like invisible threads that puppeteers use to move puppets.These fields create what physicists call \u2018action at a distance\u2019\n\nWhen I teach fascial anatomy I love to imagine these \u2018fields\u2019 extending from my body\u2019s fascia to a Neutron Star light-years away. These \u2018fields\u2019 are continuous just like fascial network & transfer of energy happens through \u2018waves\u2019, just like how tension transfer happens through the fascial network. Excitations happen in chunks of energy & this energy creates mass, that mass becomes a particle, & we are all made of particles. All atoms in our body are ripples in these \u2018fields\u2019. We are all in it & we are all it. Neither do we know their material reality as yet, nor can we see 'fields' with visible eyes, but what we do know is that these fields are connected & in that sense we are all connected.But, all this could also be an approximation as we still don\u2019t have answers to the 'why?'\n\nPerhaps one day we will dig deeper into mysteries of Universe.Till then, I dream my life away, as Ozzy Osbourne would say..\n\nStay well y'all.

But trying to figure out Yoga Sutra by itself, without background & context, is like trying to drive a car without wheels, wheels being the fundamental tenets of Sankhya Philosophy\n\nYogic scriptures are not novels to be randomly picked & read. They are manuals of knowledge that have to be studied in a systematic manner. Just as one doesn\u2019t study Calculus without an understanding of basic Mathematics, Yogic scriptures too have a certain scriptural hierarchy where each new topic builds on an earlier one\n\nThe Yoga Sutra of Patanjali is built on rock-solid foundations of Sankhya Philosophy. In fact, traditionally, Yoga Sutra (Yoga Darshana) is considered an extension of Sankhya Darshana. If Yoga is \u2018how\u2019, then Sankhya is \u2018why\u2019\n\nAnd this is why the first Sutra, \u2018atha Yoga anushasanam\u2019 emphasizes the term \u2018atha\u2019 which means \u2018now\u2026\u2019, where \u2018now\u2026\u2019 connotes a continuum of study. The usage of \u2018now\u2019 also indicates that Patanjali assumes that the students have already unpacked Sankhya philosophy & are now ready to understand Yoga Sutra\n\nI believe it is due to the lack of background understanding that the discourse of Yoga Sutra in contemporary Yoga circles has not gone beyond a few select topics like Yama-Niyama & Asana, when these topics actually cover just a few Sutras out of the total. (That doesn\u2019t mean Yama-Niyama are not important) \u00a0\n\nThis is also why popular understanding of Yoga Sutra is highly fixated only upon the \u2018Ashtanga Yoga\u2019 part, which is the practice system given by Patanjali, when there is so much more to it\n\nThere is a need to understand Yoga Sutra in its wholesomeness, as theory & practice, & not merely in its partial form as a list of practices. For this, it is important to study the ideas, concepts, notions & systems it is based in\n\nThis is why I am teaching a course in Sankhya philosophy.

Silence, some other time, for now, here's Surrender\n\nA time comes when a conscious seeker realizes that the rabbit hole of self-delusion goes deep. It\u2019s dark, dingy & uncomfortable, but the only way out is through. So, the seeker squirms through, with faith, bearing the stench of rotten memories that were wounded by attachments & blinded by neediness, allowing every bruise to peel off layers of generational conditioning, societal limitations, self-inflicted harm & grandeurs of self-delusion. Then, suddenly the tunnel caves in\n\nSurrender is the last choice the seeker exercises, the choice to fall. It is the final, conscious act, the voluntary giving up of personal sovereignty, the so-called \u2018Free Will\u2019 that we so strongly cling to\n\nLike Shraddha (faith), Sharanagati too grows over time, through participating in life. The furnace of life has to bake us enough for us to deeply recognize its value. One has to mature towards it. Till then, life is entertained, playing hide n\u2019 seek with a friend that doesn\u2019t exist\n\nLife tests us, throws us off the cliff, raises us to the clouds & then smashes us down again. Bouncing about, one sees life & self differently & learns to give up on oneself, give up oneself\n\nBut, this giving up, this surrender, does not feel like a defeat, or punishment, because it is not. It is a detachment that organically ensues, where all defenses fall away, all protection mechanisms are abandoned willfully, & the consciousness constrained by the idea of self is set free\n\nSharanagati, spiritual surrender, is the bravest act of letting go & the most authentic act of freedom a seeker can undertake. It is the biggest favor one can do for oneself. It\u2019s the final page of the book of self-love, after which one doesn\u2019t fight life, one flows with it, one doesn\u2019t love life, one becomes love \u2013 this then is the deepest rest & highest joy", "total_engagement": 1104, "engagement_rate": 0.030328837119859346, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-05T12:22:54.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "grandeurs", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "memoir", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "harm", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ambiguous", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "silence & surrender", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "strength", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "clouds", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "act", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "dingy & uncomfortable", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& self differently & learns", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "memories", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teaching", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "words", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "attachments", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328836880, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:22.016Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:22.016Z"}, {"id": 607775132328836879, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-565577855", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:22.013Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:22.013Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510607, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.654Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:04.294Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510608, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.660Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:04.302Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175153622687, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CoUhLmTvNT0/", "post_id": "3032194381709628660", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "A fish can swim because it is supported by water currents all around it.

Here\u2019s a quick glance at it. My intent is not to criticise but to raise awareness\n\nSome years ago, I took a class in a studio in Europe. At the entrance was a big Buddha statue. To my shock, the students had placed shoes on the lap & shoulders of Buddha\n\nThis for me is a prime example of Exotification, which means glamorizing & romanticizing elements of a culture without right understanding & portraying them as unusual/uncommon. Curiosity & fascination about other cultures is natural, but exotification creates sweeping generalizations & stereotypes\n\nI\u2019ve been to studios where the \u2018quintessential\u2019 Buddha statue had become just another dusty furniture piece, Lakshmi statue was used as scarf hanger, Nataraja idol was a keyholder & Shri Yantra was Yoga mat design\n\nIn a way, Exotification is an output of Tokenism, where things are done merely for effect, just to project a specific image or impress others, & not necessarily out of right understanding or intent\n\nTokenism is when one wants a Buddha statue to make the studio look \u2018spiritual\u2019/'zen', or wants deity idols or artifacts as decoration pieces. Indeed, having spiritual objects can change moods of a space, but respect & intent matters in the usage\n\n2 years ago, in an advert of a pandemic fundraiser for India, I noticed someone sitting on the Indian flag. This amounts to offense as it violates Indian Flag Code. On pointing out I was told that organizers were informed, yet the graphic was being circulated. Is this tokenism or carelessness? Tokenism is rampant in India too. One just has to see how Ganesha & Devi idols are tossed in ocean after festivals\n\nA few tips\n1)\u00a0Educate yourself about cultural contexts & artifacts, & clarify your intent\n2) If you have an altar with deities, inquire into basic altar Do\u2019s & Dont's & keep your altar clean\n3) If you already exotify cultural artifacts or use them for validation, or as a token, inquire into your need for it & refine your view towards them sincerely without feeling guilty\n4) As practitioners we borrow from the Yogic culture, our sensitivity matters.

Ever since then, he has been known for pushing the rock tirelessly till eternity.\n\nThe famous contemporary existential philosopher, Albert Camus compares the absurdity of our life with the situation of Sisyphus in his book The Myth of Sisyphus.\n\nCamus says that the \u2018absurdity\u2019 of life is in the fact that there is a basal conflict between what we want from the world and what we find in the world. He says that it is not possible to find meaning and purpose in life unless we totally accept this absurdity. If we don\u2019t do that, life itself comes across as a meaningless endeavour.\n\nWe have to craft out meaning for ourselves in this profoundly mysterious journey called life.\n\nYogic tradition too accepts life's absurdity & helps us create a meaningful life by asking us to live in faith, faith in the fact that we are loved and cared for by the Divine.\n\nThis is called Shraddh\u0101 in Yogic thought. The organic output of Shraddh\u0101 is surrender to the Divine will, called Sharan\u0101gati.\n\nShri Krishna says in the Gita, 'yoga-k\u1e63hema\u1e41 vah\u0101myaham' - surrender to me, I will take care of you.\n\nI believe that the Divine provides constant promptings to help us grow through life, but we are too busy in transient pursuits like King Sisyphus, pushing a sliding boulder over & over again.\n\nYes, life is absurd & challenging, but believing deeply that the Divine loves & cares for us can help ease our existential anxiety, making us live effortlessly.\n\nAs Camus says at the end of his essay, \"The struggle of life itself ... is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy\".", "total_engagement": 491, "engagement_rate": 0.01348864042196643, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-08T15:57:56.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& over", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "loves & cares", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hill", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "absurdity", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "absurd &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mythology", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "greek", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rock", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "albert camus", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328836971, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:22.667Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:22.667Z"}, {"id": 607775132328836967, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1002125655", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:22.652Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:22.652Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510613, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.743Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:04.390Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510614, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:24.748Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:04.396Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175153622592, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cocd7npPnAh/", "post_id": "3034431889306710049", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "I am sure we all have faced an Asana practice plateau sometime in our Yoga life. The immediate tendency would be to be frustrated, feel not good enough, & do something different, something more, mix & match practices, or even start something completely new. \n\nImpulsive solutions emerging from frustration could distract the practitioner from the Yoga path. What I propose here instead is to be with that plateau, deeply listen, examine & reflect on the points below, instead of reacting with a feeling of inadequacy\n\n1) Being stuck in your practice could help you become empathetic toward yourself. Know that the physical body has limits & each person has their own limitations. So, being in a practice plateau could help you examine your limits & work with them, not against them\n\n2) Hitting a practice plateau could help you inspect if the plateau is due to your own experience, as in, \u201cwhy am I stuck at the same point in a forward bend since a year\u201d, or due to your desire to be like someone else, as in, \u201cwhy am I not able to extend as much as that person on Instagram\u201d. This inspection could help you become more realistic about how you set your goals\n\n3) Being in a practice plateau could make you examine if your lifestyle variables like diet, sleep, and mental state are in regulation. This is a big one, Yoga practice goes hand in hand with these variables & reflecting on them could help you generate a wholesome view of your practice\n\n4) Sometimes, not growing in your physical practice could be an invitation to become patient with yourself & examine the ambitious benchmarks you\u2019ve set for yourself. The body has its own time & wisdom which may not always conform to your impatience\n\n5) Being stuck in your physical practice could be a blessing in disguise, inviting you to step back, take it easy & explore the deeper, subtler practices of Yoga\n\nSo, be with your practice plateau, listen deeply & reflect, instead of reacting with frustration.\n\nYour Yoga practice is not here to entertain your fancies but to lead to the truth of Self. Be still & listen...\n\nSave & Share", "total_engagement": 1210, "engagement_rate": 0.033240845031729895, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-09T14:21:31.000Z", "brands":

"media": [], "post_text": "Hi, my name is Prasad & I am an introvert\n\nMy work demands that I be amongst people, which I genuinely enjoy, but at heart I am a recluse\n\nMy social engagements are bare minimum, my phone conversations are brief, I have very few close friends, I love being at home, but above all, I cherish my aloneness.All this at the risk of being labeled insensitive, rude, proud & weird\n\nNo, I don\u2019t hate people, I don\u2019t think world is bad, I am not anxious about the future of humanity, I am not overwhelmed by social situations, but, genuinely, I am neither keen to know who is doing what, nor nervous about not knowing others\n\nI am over the need to excel, I\u2019ve had enough of wanting to prove myself, I am done with finding meaning & purpose, & am happy to follow when not required to lead\n\nI have always been reclusive.But accepting it has been a painful journey. I\u2019ve spent years doubting myself, thinking something was wrong with me. I\u2019ve beaten myself up for not being outgoing & bent backward to fit in by faking extrovertedness. Even the competitive sport I chose as a teenager was an individual sport. It has taken me decades to accept my personality trait (swabh\u0101va) & turn it into my strength - thanks to my Guru & sadhan\u0101\n\nAs I look back, I am grateful for my nature. As a boy it helped channel my anxieties through art, which was my only recourse of self-expression. It made me more reflective & less reactive, which organically turned me toward Dhy\u0101na as a teenager. Later, my meditations lead me to explore the practice of silence (mauna), at times happily being in silence retreats for 4 long months, alone. Each turn made me comfortable with myself\n\nToday, if I want, I can genuinely be in a social group, with empathy, for I am assured in my aloneness. I am there for me, even when others don\u2019t want to be. This helps me be there for others, if they need\n\nPopular culture celebrates extrovertedness, but not everyone needs to be out there as a foot soldier activist. Revolutions can also start quietly in a laboratory of a scientist\n\nWe all have our personality type, become comfortable with yours & grow\n\nNote: Introvertedness is not all-or-none, it exists as a continuum.

Rather, wherever he looks he sees the manifestation of His worshipable Lord.\"\n\nMy dearest Mauli, Sant Jnaneshwar (13th century) too says in Jnaneshwari, \"wherever you see any being, see them as manifestation of divine\"\n\nEven Kabir (15th century) says, \"Scholars are never made\u00a0from reading countless books. You only need to understand 'love'\nto be a true scholar.\"\n\nAll images of the divine are only to guide us back to the divine within.

Now do you?\nStudent: No\nTeacher: Wait, I will push. Now?\nStudent: Ah!! Now I feel the pose. \n\nSuch a dialogue is common place in many Asana classes\n\nThe \"service industry\" nature of Yoga makes many Asana teachers feel obligated to provide their students the \u2018feel\u2019 in poses\n\nOften, the teacher's expertise at teaching is measured by how much the student \u2018feels\u2019 the pose. Disgruntled students leave the class saying \"I didnt feel anything\". Atleast for a teacher who is starting off, this is a nightmare. So, every \"Yes, I feel the pose\" from a student is a validation of sorts to the teacher's skill\n\nMore the 'feel', the better the class, such correlation could compel the teacher to overtly load a student if the student doesnt 'feel' the pose, not only to make the student happy but also to make themselves feel validated. Jumping on the student's back, standing on their knees, lying down with complete weight thrown on student who is already trying their \u2018best\u2019 & is in peak contraction (full range of motion) could become a formula for injury\n\nWhen we look at asana practice as more than a project of stretching a muscle & see it as nervous system training instead, the tonality of teaching changes\n\nThe practice doesnt become an opportunity for instant gratification. Instead, patience & empathy helps improve the 'feel' component gradually. The practitioner progresses using the path of patient practice instead of the path of pain\n\nAll this & more will be discussed in my upcoming Asana focused worlshop called \"Rethinking asana\". If you want to create a more stable, empathetic & patient practice, and also learn how to teach that way, you may want to consider joining the course\n\nBut for now, Remember,\n\u2022 Injuries happen because we are not patient with our limits.\n\u2022 Injuries happen because we blindly agree with someone else's idea of right alignment.\n\u2022 Injuries happen because we seek perfection in a pose when the true perfection is that of the Self alone.\n.\nTrain your body with patience and treat your body with respect.

Therefore, even though I love to meditate, every meditation is a sour experience for me.\" He then gave me a warm hug and walked away...\n.\nYou don't 'have to' sit in lotus pose for the meditation to be effective. In fact lotus pose has more to do with Pranayama then with meditation. There are various seated meditation postures mentioned across traditions. Maharishi Vyasa in his commentary on Yoga Sutra has given 13 basic meditation sitting postures (Asana).\n.\nIt is very important to realize that the path of Yoga, including all its methodologies, are aligned to transform an individual. Every individual is unique. Therefore, when guiding asana, pranayama, kriya and meditation, the individual's uniqueness, capabilities and limitations need to be kept in mind.\n\nGeneralisation of instructions is fine at a superficial level but after a certain maturity the methods and approches have to be personalised to the practitioner.\n\nGuide the students from where they are, not from where you want them to be.\n\n#meditation #yogapractice", "total_engagement": 946, "engagement_rate": 0.02598829702480701, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-21T12:31:19.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "issues", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "students", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "content", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "workshop", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "floor", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "back", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teacher", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "chair", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "experience", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "participant", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "meditation", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "meditation"}, {"name": "yogapractice"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Family & Relationships", "confidence": 0.9914142489433289}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328837201, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:25.187Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:25.187Z"}, {"id": 607775132328837200, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1642233100", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:25.169Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:25.169Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510635, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.130Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:04.814Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510636, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.135Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:04.824Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175164589146, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CpAOV8SDtrC/", "post_id": "3044496428590095042", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/254a48661d604e101a3dfcbdacc9054d.JPEG", "phash": "91f9511a722d55f8", "image_entities": [{"entity": "photograph", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8590663075447083}, {"entity": "sitting", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.430665522813797}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7306630611419678}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.42003464698791504}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.34253501892089844}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.33586519956588745}, {"entity": "dress", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.27905750274658203}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T01:55:07.632Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-24T01:47:56.466Z"}}], "post_text": "Today is Thursday, Guru day. It will be little over a year that my 1st Yoga Guru passed away. Back in 1985, he told us, Yoga is personal well-being for self-realization.That was Yoga for me, still is & will be\n\nBut since I started teaching internationally in 2003 I encountered narratives of Yoga that were all over the place \n\n2003-2005, teachers in Europe told me real Yoga was strict postural alignment & flexibility \n\n2006-2009 was all about Astanga Vinyasa.\nAshtangies tried convincing me that authentic Yoga was about the 'flow' & Patanjali was the source of Vinyasa flow \n\n2009-2011 was about Yoga injuries.Yoga was looked at with suspicion. Safety was on everyone's mind \n\n2011-2012 was my tryst with Bikram Hot Yoga & 'Kundalini' Yoga.I was also told why Hot rooms are crucial & that Patanjali had prophesized birth of Yogi Bhajun \n\nCome 2013, Fascia was on everyone's lips. Suddenly Yoga was all about Meridians.Yoga became Yin & slow became sacred \n\n2013 - 2016, 'Fascia'nation of long stretches hybridized with Taoism remained popular. Over stretched, injured Yogis could now officially rest in a pose \n\nPost 2016, Yoga became all about Movement. Yoga teachers became 'Movement educators' as Asana became 'conscious movement' \n\nFrom 2018 on, Yoga & activism became synonymous. If you were a teacher & not linked to some kind of 'cause' you weren't compassionate enough \n\nAll this as Yoga industry grappled with stories of abusive Gurus, cults, social media narcissism, cultural appropriation & cancel culture.Many well meaning teachers were overwhelmed, stopped teaching or migrated to other modalities \n\n& then, Pandemic happened & Yoga went Zoom!! Many lost jobs, sold studios or gave up teaching.The tech savvy migrated to 2D screens to teach 3D bodies, others went into self-doubt or debt\n\nThis note is not a criticism, its my personal observation \n\nI think our 'Yoga Industry' is in its infancy. Akin to a child wearing parents' shoes & pretending to be an adult, it is experimenting & trying to find its own identity & place in a bigger consumeristic ecosystem \n\nYoga teachers, it will help to find clarity in what Yoga is for you & not confuse yourself with changing narratives\ud83d\ude4f", "total_engagement": 1387, "engagement_rate": 0.03810334880909865, "network_type": "instagram",

Instagram has increased considerably & with it has increased trolling, cancelling, blocking & triggered responses\n\nI make sure to write with an all-round perspective & a considerate tone. I am neither looking for an agreement from the reader, nor wanting to convert them to my perspective. My sole aim is to stimulate reflection & research. Yes, at times I do call spade a spade & back my arguments with valid references where possible. But perhaps that triggers people. Most triggered pushbacks are either emotive or made from a point of subjectivism \u2013 they are neither rooted in historical evidence nor scriptural citation. In such times, trolls usually resort to personal attack, which itself tells that they don\u2019t have a valid argument \n\nQuoting here just 3 of the most common pushbacks I\u2019ve received\n\n1) Yoga is not ancient. Its just 100-odd years old\n\nThis is a common argument made by those considering Asana-based physical practice as \u2018Yoga\u2019. Neither Yoga nor Asana practice is 100 years old, & there is enough evidence for it. Many seem to have misinterpreted recent scholarly works on Modern Yoga & exaggerated this point\n\n\u00a02)\u00a0Your posts are disruptive to my Business Model which is based on physical Yoga practice\n\nFirstly, I am in no way responsible for your Business Model. Secondly, I am not against physical yogic practice. In fact, I believe it is crucial for our times. I know many who have beautifully integrated their new understanding of ancient Yogic culture into their physical Yoga-based business model. My ideas could become disruptive only if you are closed to newer perspectives\n\n\u00a03) This is what you think, but I \u2018feel\u2019 Yoga is\u2026\n\nThough Yoga is a personal experience it is rooted in a mature intellectual tradition that has evolved through symbolism, language, logic, moral & social contexts.

Unfortunately, one so-called \u2018style\u2019 among them is Hatha Yoga\n\nWe live in times where the way one does posture practice has come to be known as \u2018style\u2019 of Yoga. That is because Asana practice has popularly come to be seen as Yoga. But Hatha Yoga is neither a \u2018style\u2019 of Yoga, nor a way of doing postures\n\nAs if that were not enough, Hatha Yoga is also perceived as a \u2018gentle\u2019 style of Yoga (gentle way of doing postures), as opposed to physically intensive ways. Even popular websites like WebMD dumb down Hatha Yoga to a \u2018Gentle\u2019 physical practice, stating - \"Hatha yoga originally meant the physical practice of yoga, the poses rather than the breathing exercises.\u201d \n\nLabelling Hatha Yoga a posture practice is like reducing an entire 7-course meal to a plate of salad. That's because,\n\nHatha Yoga is (at least) a 1000-year-old philosophy & practice system of psycho-physical transformation aimed at Self-realization (Moksha). I do not think any of the \u2018styles\u2019 of \u2018Yoga\u2019 either aim for Self-realization or provide a complete system of transformation towards that end. This itself makes Hatha Yoga an odd term in the list of Yoga \u2018styles\u2019\n\nHatha Yoga is also not limited only to posture practice (Asana). Traditional Hatha teachings mainly give five core corporal practices, namely, Shatakarma, Asana, Pranayama, Mudra & Bandha, called Hatha Kriya. These Hatha Kriyas are done for mind-body refinement to reach the psychological state of Samadhi. Yogi Swatmarama, the author of Hatha Pradipika, emphatically states that \u201cthe knowledge of Hatha is given only for attainment of Raja Yoga\u201d (HP 1:2). Here, Raja Yoga means path of Self-realization\n\nSuch erroneous generalizations occur because we correlate the entire system of Hatha Yoga with one of its parts, the Asana practice\n\nIf you want to refine your outlook here are suggestions\n\n1)\u00a0If you just do asana, say you do asana \u2013 no need to call it Hatha Yoga\n\n2)\u00a0Desist from referring to Hatha Yoga as a \u2018style\u2019 of Yoga\n\n3)\u00a0Do not label \u2018Hatha Yoga\u2019 as a \u2018gentle\u2019 practice because, even etymologically 'Hatha' means forceful, so, in no way it is gentle !\n\n4) Try to view Yoga in its entirety", "total_engagement": 2682, "engagement_rate": 0.07367929452487569, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-02T12:46:29.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "pranayama mudra", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "practice", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "philosophy & practice", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "style", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bandha", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "times", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Beauty & Fitness", "confidence": 0.9996485710144043}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328837336, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:26.537Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:26.537Z"}, {"id": 607775132328837335, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1040477519", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:26.533Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:26.533Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510643, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.222Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:04.954Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510644, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.227Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:04.984Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175170273806, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CpU3od-PqUy/", "post_id": "3050307521156654386", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/aa96de761ce4c7573337ec1eff4f1f67.JPEG", "phash": "eb81957e817a95d0", "image_entities": [{"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9736189246177673}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.49823835492134094}, {"entity": "press conference", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.44201725721359253}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9394872188568115}, {"entity": "business card", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6541358232498169}, {"entity": "flyer", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4632710814476013}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2608928978443146}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T01:28:56.462Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-24T01:47:34.782Z"}}], "post_text": "I am often asked how to create a regulated life with Yoga.

Life is the training ground of a Yogin.\n.\nAccept your inadequacies, transform them with faith and meet yourSelf there where the mind rejoices in its own bliss.\n.\nThe seeker must be ready to bring forth their inner darkness honestly, recognize it objectively and transform it lovingly.\n.\nThis requires a lot of strength. \nHave you found the strength?\n.\nWho or What is your strength on the path ?", "total_engagement": 1121, "engagement_rate": 0.030795857256668772, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-04T13:39:08.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "strength", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "transformation", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "purpose", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "shadow", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "trials", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "worst", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "option", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mind", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "light", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "heat", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "process", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "diamond", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328837365, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:27.081Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:27.081Z"}, {"id": 607775132328837364, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1550470384", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:27.075Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:27.075Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510647, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.244Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:05.028Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510648, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.251Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:05.034Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175177662344, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CpfVfB3POVf/", "post_id": "3053253563661477215", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/d569561a128f1930650d4cca69febcf5.JPEG", "phash": "dacf5830ce3875c4", "image_entities": [{"entity": "cool", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8728626370429993}, {"entity": "t-shirt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8183938264846802}, {"entity": "t-shirt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7431116104125977}, {"entity": "tree", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4690139889717102}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4217887818813324}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9939024448394775}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9800519943237305}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9215422868728638}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4330858886241913}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3571789264678955}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3381386697292328}, {"entity": "sweater", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.255573570728302}, {"entity": "jeans", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2101338803768158}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T02:22:07.340Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-24T01:48:36.309Z"}}], "post_text": "In spite of being on the Yogic path for 6 long years I am still such a mess, I don\u2019t know if I will ever find peace\u201d - I\u2019ve heard such statements of defeat from my students and mentees way too many times.\n \nThose of us walking sincerely on the spiritual path are in a fix of sorts. We don\u2019t like our mental limitations but we also want quick resolution from our messy mind. Such inner tug-of-war makes us impatient with ourselves and also with the Yogic process. This impatience can result in a lot of unconscious self-harm...\n\nThis is why, I feel, it is very, very important to be patient and good to ourselves on the Yogic journey. The mind that we are dealing with has matured over thousands of life times. It has developed a personality of its own. A few years of Sadhana is simply not enough to deal with the mind that has become us. This is why, patience is a very important virtue to cultivate on the path of Yoga.\n \nTo be patient and good to ourselves we have to first stop comparing our spiritual journey with that of others (especially on Social Media). Just cuz\u2019 someone has had an \u201cextra ordinary\u201d spiritual experience that sounds cool, doesn\u2019t mean you too should have it \u2013 unfortunately, Social Media can make us feel that way.\n\nYou are an individual, your growth and experiences are, and will be, unique to you. Yogic spirituality and spiritual FOMO can\u2019t go hand in hand.\n\nHere are two tips for all who feel impatient with themselves on the Yogic journey.\n\n\u2022 Allow yourself to ignore your little transgressions in life. Permit yourself to let some mistakes slide. It's fine to go easy with your errors and laugh at your follies. You know what, you don't have to figure out things all the time - allow things to figure themselves out sometimes.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t strain yourself in wanting to leave a mark or wanting to make it big in this world. Relax and realize that your birth is the greatest miracle and your inner contentment is your greatest contribution to the world. Be still and know.\n.\nWhat are your ways to be gentle with yourself ?\nPlease share \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe", "total_engagement": 843, "engagement_rate": 0.023158704431196945, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-07T13:36:49.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "patience", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mentees", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "students", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "peace", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mind", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mess", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "times", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "path", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "individual", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "experience", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328837397, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:27.327Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:27.327Z"}, {"id": 607775132328837395, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1083782486", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:27.321Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:27.321Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510649, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.257Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:05.056Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510650, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.264Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:05.063Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175177662331, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cpk1VixPTY8/", "post_id": "3054801024171456060", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/2f8b58935769e6b693425e1344b16a8e.JPEG", "phash": "c06b1d8ba5b5da98", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beard", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9250858426094055}, {"entity": "cool", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7863706350326538}, {"entity": "facial hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.440439909696579}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3136025369167328}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9856472015380859}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9695874452590942}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8346022367477417}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6617575883865356}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6607660055160522}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5079885125160217}, {"entity": "chair", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4778309464454651}, {"entity": "scarf", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2529715299606323}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24032576382160187}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T01:03:29.023Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-24T01:48:34.327Z"}}], "post_text": "Thursdays, Guruvar, the feels hit differently, always !!

For the last 12 years we had met many times, spoke lots, cried many tears together and melted in assuring hugs of Her loving devotion. Our laughters together, those stories of Her grace, those long pregnant silences, the muffled tears reminiscing Her, I will deeply cherish, and miss. \n\nWhen I met him, just before the pandemic lockdown, he had said \"I am on a wheel-chair now but She doesn't want me to go so soon. I will serve Her till I go, till my last breath\" - and that he did !\n\nHe was getting weaker by the year, I knew his time was to come soon, but those innocent eyes kept sparkling with more overflowing love as years passed by. His Love towards Hazrat was like that of a child towards his mom. His sajd\u0101 (reverence), his tasleem (surrender) is very rarely encountered. It's hard to find genuine lovers like him, those who have allowed themselves to drown in the ecstasy of loving surrender. \n\nNow he is with Her, resting and playing in her lap. We drank from the same spring, we were intoxicated by the same waters, as time stood still in the Rose Garden of Gulrukh. \n\nAs Hilmi Dedebaba would say \"A tent is erected where lovers are slowly cooked \u2013 this stopping place for love addicts is really a rose garden if you look....\" \n\nGod speed my friend, my fellow Lover.

Over last 4 weeks we have deeply reflected upon a scripture called Sankhya Karika of Ishwarakrishna (5th CE). Multiple hours of discussions, home work, reflections, questioning, studying & applying has shifted something within all of us, including myself \n\nIf I had to summarise the profound teachings of Sankhya in one sentence it would be this - Play, don't get played\n\nThe Yoga Sutra is based on Sankhya philosophy & therefore the above statement extends to it too. This is why traditionally the student studied Sankhya philosophy before studying Yoga Sutra\n\nBoth these schools tell us that we, as eternal consciousness (Purusha), are immersed in materiality called Prakriti. This Prakriti includes everything that we think we are, i.e our body, mind, thoughts, posessions & relations. \n\nIf we are alert & use Prakriti to evolve, we realise who we truly are. If we don't, we sink deeper into the sinking pit of delusion called Sansara\n\nSo, my rescue remedy to the students is - Play the game of Prakriti, play life enthusiastically & sincerely, use whatever it brings to you & keep evolving towards your true nature (Purusha). But in the bargain, make sure you don't get played by it\n\nThe Upanishads too tell us that our anxieties are predicated upon our mind-body identities. So, play your roles, fulfil your responsibilities, don't avoid, do what you ought to, but dont get attached to any of it.

when I came across the work of the legendary American Fashion Photographer Herb Ritts. I just couldn't understand how someone could see things in a dual tone the way he did when there was so much colour to capture.\n.\nIt fascinated me so much that I started purposefully changing the way I viewed things in my mind. When I would look at people and things I would change perspectives in my head, flip from colour to Black & White, to dual tone, back to colour and so on. It helped me understand that what we see is what we want to see.This knowing, in my early spiritual life, helped me in my pursuit of figuring out myself. \n.\nLater, in the 2000s, when I came across the work of another legendary American Fashion Photographer Bruce Webber I started appreciating the beauty of forms, human or otherwise, and seeing that everything and everyone is beautiful in their own unique way. It helped me refine my appreciation towards all forms of creation.\n.\nI am a recreational photographer. I love taking potraits shots of people. Photography has helped me understand that our view of Life depends on the kind of Light that illuminates our mind.\n.\nPlease know that you all are beautiful in your own unique ways. Don't try to be like someone else, instead, see yourself in the light of your own calm mind - you will love what you will see...\n.\nSharing with you a few of my B/W compositions. All were taken spontaneously without a standard equipment. Some were taken during a Yoga teacher training, thanks to volunteering students & a student camera sponsor.\n.\nEnjoy your weekend", "total_engagement": 358, "engagement_rate": 0.00983489464575149, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-12T03:36:37.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "colour", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "someone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "photography", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "american", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tone", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mind", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "herb ritts", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "work", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "black & white", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "photographer", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328837529, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:28.037Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:28.037Z"}, {"id": 607775132328837528, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1220979457", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:28.020Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:28.020Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510655, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.331Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:05.148Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510656, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.336Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:05.155Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175182901106, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cpz9rEqjwN5/", "post_id": "3059059812698358649", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/3563c27ac11764b6af405e7eb7ca84de.JPEG", "phash": "a788f0970c6770cf", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beard", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8801803588867188}, {"entity": "facial hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8557490110397339}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.28949517011642456}, {"entity": "sweatshirt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2758675515651703}, {"entity": "moustache", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24307973682880402}, {"entity": "sunglasses", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9704871773719788}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.628570020198822}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5812057852745056}, {"entity": "scarf", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4487760663032532}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.37344956398010254}, {"entity": "man", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.34525227546691895}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T01:47:14.904Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-24T01:49:37.451Z"}}], "post_text": "This talk with @mpoweredwithmrudul was inspired from one of my favourite dialogues in the Upanishads - between Sage Yajnavalkya and his wife Maitreyee\n\n\"My dear Maitreyee, know that a wife loves her husband not for his sake but for her own sake, for the sake of the Self. In loving him she loves the One who is both in her as well as in him. It is really this One whom she loves. Similarly it is so for the husband, and indeed, for all love relationships - father and son, mother and son, mother and daughter, father and daughter, friend and friend, and so on. Whatever is held to be dear is so because of that one Self. It is this Self that has to be seen, heard of, thought about, meditated upon.

His teachings too were written not in Sanskrit but in Pali. Later, with influence of Tibetan Buddhism, texts were written in Tibetan languages\n\nOver last 1500 years, Yogic Bhakti Movement saw a wave of vernacular literature that expressed ideas of Yogis that came from the rock bottom of society & reformed people using local languages because Sanskrit was NOT the language of the masses\n\nRamcharitmanas, a 17th CE retelling of Ramayana in Awadhi language is often called \u20185th Veda\u2019 in north India.

The understanding of Yoga Sutra without a proper understanding of Sankhya tends to be shallow,\u00a0often leading to misinterpretations.\n\nI have always maintained that the study of Yoga philosophy should not be haphazard, because the Yogic texts are graded, based on what level of maturity the student brings to the table. There are scriptures for all levels of students and can be taught to all, depending on the context & capability. When a student randomly picks up a scripture to study, a text that does not align with their level of development, misrepresentations tend to happen. This is why having a teacher, having faith in the path of Yoga, being patient with ourselves, & being accountable to our own practice (sadhana) are the four key traits of Swadhyaya.\n\nSharing here 3 points in which Sankhya Darshana can be lived.These points were a part of my Sankhya course\u2019s concluding slide. Hope they inspire you to stay positive on the path.\n\n\u2022 Your mind & body are Prakriti. Sankhya says Prakriti is generous and selfless.Therefore, use your mind and body as a precious resource, with respect and responsibility.\n\n\u2022 No matter what Drama you are going through in life \u2013 remember, the True Self (Purusha) is always beyond it. So, work through your life situations and keep refining yourself till you realize your True Self.\n\n\u2022 Your current state of mind and life are not absolute. You are not stuck in your situation. Yes, the mind and emotions can be transformed with dedication, faith, and effort. Life situations can be surmounted, as far as you don\u2019t get distracted. Keep the faith, and stay on the path with a one-pointed focus.\u00a0\n.\n#yogaphilosophy #yogasutra", "total_engagement": 509, "engagement_rate": 0.013983132331529353, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-19T16:13:05.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "level", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "points", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "understanding", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "patient", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mind & body", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "with ourselves & being", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "student", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "path", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "context &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "study", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reference", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "yogaphilosophy"}, {"name": "yogasutra"}], "mentions": [{"name": "samyayogahealing"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328837673, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:29.179Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:29.179Z"}, {"id": 607775132328837671, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "601860927", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:29.172Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:29.172Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510663, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.396Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:05.302Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510664, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.410Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:05.308Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175182901102, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CqAwSlevKYl/", "post_id": "3062660130039178789", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/9ef4971766a73f45e5134e2b9df5dcef.JPEG", "phash": "caa3954aab956ad2", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beard", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.920567512512207}, {"entity": "facial hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4971863031387329}, {"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.42618873715400696}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.40647614002227783}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.39584726095199585}, {"entity": "document", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.35412368178367615}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8452862501144409}, {"entity": "flyer", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6402567028999329}, {"entity": "necklace", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6166138648986816}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4517238140106201}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2080710381269455}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T01:59:05.563Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-24T01:49:11.984Z"}}], "post_text": "I used to teach across Europe, once or twice every year, since 2004.

India has always been a land of diverse languages, sub-cultures, localized traditions - including languages, scripts, customs and ways of life, that has thrived over the past 3500 years. \n\nHere's an example. Today we celebrate our New Year. But, as seen in the picture, it is called by different names & even celebrated in different ways in parts of the country. At times the rituals and customs are so different that one can't even recognize if its the same festival \n\nThis diversity is the hallmark of India and the accompanying complexity needs to be kept in context when studying Yoga. If not, things come across as ambiguous and confusing, making the student feel they dont know enough.\n\nI talk to many Yoga teachers who have a genuine interest in wanting to understand Yogic history and culture but they approach the subject with a unidimensional mindset, i.e, to know Yoga through one book or one lineage. Such a mindset will only offer a partial view of Yoga.\n\nLooking at the complex interconnectedness of ideas, philosophies and traditions stretching across thousands of years, Yoga should be recognized as a complex body of knowledge that ought to be studied patiently, over time, in context, under someone who has lived and studied in the ecosystem of its origins.\n\nWhen one has an

After a 4-month silence (mauna sadhana) I had the honor to tend to the Dhuni (sacred fire) of Mahayogi Matsyendra Nath, the founder of Hatha path of Yoga. It prompted me to post this,\n\nThe inspiration behind asanas that we practice comes mainly from the Hatha tradition.The Hatha Marga (path) has its own profound concepts & philosophy that takes the seeker all the way to Moksha, Self-realization\n\nBelow are a few couplets from an old scripture of the Hatha tradition. It is a dialogue between the Guru, Matsyendra Nath & his disciple, Gorakh Nath. I had translated them in English from Awadhi language back when I was studying them with my teacher. The teachings mentioned below may not be immediately relevant to us but they do give us a glimpse into the depth of symbolism & the profundity of the Hatha path. Enjoy,\n\nGorakh: What is root, what is branch? Who is Guru, who is disciple? In what essence can one delight in the Self?\n\nMatsyendra replies: Mind is root, Prana is branch. Om (shabda) is Guru, scripture (shastra) is disciple. The essence is Self-realization, in which one wanders rejoicing\n\nGorakh: What is seed, what is field? What is direct hearing (shravan)? What is true vision? What is Yoga, what is its method? What is liberation? & what is salvation?\n\nMatsyendra replies: The word (OM) is seed, perception is field. Scriptural teaching is direct hearing & discriminative discernment is true vision. Ocean is Yoga & land is method, light is liberation & flames are salvation\n\nGorakh: What is creator of body & from where does radiance (Tej) arise? What is mouth of Divine wisdom? How can Unseen be seen?\n\nMatsyendra replies: Absolute is the creator of body, out of Absolute radiance arises, nothingness is the mouth of Divine wisdom & via Guru's grace & realization of disciple alone the unseen is seen\n\nGorakh: How many thousand moons exist in body?

At times I would throw my arm around her & invariably every time she would say endearingly \"ah, you have become big now, your weight will squish me\". This had become our ritual of sorts. One such day, I threw my arm around her but she didn't react to my \"sleep well mumma\", she had left her body, she was dead\n\nDeath of our dear ones is traumatic indeed but, somewhere, it is also a reminder to us of our own eventual departure. Each streak of grey, every new wrinkle, every age spot is an invitation to pay heed to what truly matters\n\nInquiry into death is an integral part of traditional Yoga. Upanishads are full of it. Patanjali too refers to it as Abhinivesha. In Mahabharata, a celestial Crane intercepted Yudhishthira & asked him, \"what is the greatest wonder?\u201d Yudhishthira replied that humans know death is inevitable, yet they live as if it will not happen to them. Truly, how hard we try to distract ourselves from accepting this fact by labeling death as something bad/evil or by hoarding stuff, or obsessing over our physical body\n\nOptimize your living. Make every moment count. Do not wait to sing the song & dance the dance you always wanted to. Embrace your existence in the now, settle your conflicts, make closures, simplify life & lighten yourself. Living in fear, worry, regret & guilt is just not worth it. Yes, there is primal anxiety deeply ingrained in us, but only in honest acceptance of death can one make life truly meaningful\n\nI've been fascinated by the topic of death since my childhood, maybe cuz' I was a hyper-anxious sickly child always in & out of hospitals. My inquiry into death deepened after death of my beloved parents which happened in\u00a0quick succession. I believe life is preparing us every moment for our eventual passing. My parent\u2019s death hit me hard but it also empowered me. It woke me up from the deep slumber of taking my life for granted. I now see life & death as warp & woof of the very existence, a continuum of sorts. \n\nI feel dealing with death is an important process we all need to learn from.

In the case of self, it\u2019s the ideas, & in the case of selfie, it\u2019s the pixels. Both are virtual, apparent & not really real\n\nIndian & Western philosophers have dissected the problem of self for over 2500 years\n\nBuddhism says that \u2018self\u2019 is just a byproduct of desires & attachments. If you like, there is a video of my talk on this Buddhist theory - the concept of Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da on my Youtube channel\n\nEven, Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara says that the \u2018self\u2019 is an illusion (mithy\u0101) & that all there is, is Brahman (Universal Consciousness)\n\nIn the Yoga Sutra, Patanjali calls it Asmit\u0101 which results from Avidy\u0101, the misconception of regarding Purusha as Prakriti\n\nIn the West too, thinkers like Plato, Descartes, Hume, Freud & Heidegger have challenged the idea of self\n\nAs more & more of us spend time on Social Media, especially as Entrepreneurs, our attachment to the idea of self becomes tighter. We start taking our self too seriously - well, cuz' there's a 'self' brand at stake \ud83d\ude04\n\nSo much time & energy invested in protecting & moulding this idea of 'self' according to public perception & trends. The more this 'self' becomes real, the more the anxiety. No doubt we are so exhausted !!\n\nRelax, your self is as virtual as your selfie. Be kind to this self (& others'), have clarity in what you want to do in life, & try to live in contentment & simplicity\n\nEverything is dispensable, even you. Recognize this & don\u2019t unnecessarily get anxious about being something that others are, or what others think you should be\n\nFocus your energies instead on discovering what you truly are beyond the ideas of 'self' you have created in your head. This is what Yoga is truly all about\n\nChill, don\u2019t take yourself seriously but do take yourself sincerely\n\nHave fun \u2764\ufe0f", "total_engagement": 667, "engagement_rate":

of sorts. But when you hurt - you don't just internalize those feelings for yourself; you also inflict them upon others. \n\nA wise man once said know thyself, meaning not only knowing oneself intellectually or emotionally but feeling the truth about oneself internally.\n\nTo achieve this, Maun Sadhana was taught in India as a cure-all for all ills. This ancient practice helps us cleanse and free ourselves from mental strife which can be traced back to the root cause of suffering - which is ignorance. Step by step, the process leads to our highest spiritual goal: freedom from all emotional discomforts from ignorance.\n\nDiscover the insights and wisdom that Prasad Rangnekar provides on Maun Sadhana and its power to transform our lives!

I consider Emotion management a Life Skill, just like swimming, hygiene, & decision-making, something we all need to learn as the world becomes increasingly anxious & uncertain\n\nCuriously enough, someone asked if the course was about \u2018Nervous System Hacks', another asked if it was about \u2018Brain rewiring\u2019 \u2013 it made me write this \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc\n\nI know the subject of Nervous System regulation is trendy (& very useful). But, there is a specific reason why my course is titled \u2018Yoga Based Emotion Management\u2019 & not \u2018Nervous System Regulation\u2019 or 'Brain Hack'\n\nI refuse to reduce emotions to Limbic (Neuronal) activity alone, as I do not prescribe to the materialism theory of mind (physicalism). Though I accept that the Neural Correlates of human emotions can be demonstrated by Brain scans, for me emotions are a complex phenomenon arising out of intricate interactions of many variables that can\u2019t be reduced to physical parts alone\n\nSecondly, the course is \u2018Yoga based\u2019 Emotion Management. Traditional Yoga works with the self in context. The subjective aspect of an experience (called Qualia) is crucial to any Yogic exploration, including the explorations in my course \n\nI have not seen any solid argument that can comprehensively explain the qualitative characteristics of a person\u2019s experience. This is because subjective experiences are not reducible to physical properties of the Brain/Nervous system alone\n\nEg: The Blue color of a Krishna idol makes me cry out of devotion, but for someone, it is just a color that hardly creates any excitation response. The experience of \u2018Blue\u2019 in both is different\n\nThis is what makes emotions subject-specific. This is also why my course gives importance to components of self-introspection, self-reflection, & witnessing because one trigger could arouse different responses in different subjects\n\nThough we will also work with Nervous System regulation, the course is not all about that. It is a deep dive into creating personal accountability towards one\u2019s own emotions \u2013 the kind of work I feel is more comprehensive than generic Nervous System \u2018hacks\u2019",

a Yoga practitioner lies in,\n- Faithful Commitment to Sadhana\n- Curiousity & critical thinking mindset\n- Viewing Yoga as a path of self understanding\n- Honoring the history & roots of Yoga, &\n- Above all, being humble & empathetic\n\nYou may be a master of anatomy & biomechanics but may not be doing your sadhana. You may know Sanskrit & Veda Mantra but it may have become a tool for you to gain social validation. Insta Followers can be bought & also can teaching certificates & accreditions. These days one can professes initiation in a 'traditional lineage' even without being officially initiated by the Guru. So, none of these claims automatically assert one as a Yoga Sadhaka. Stocking up on more qualifications & newer modalities may not be the only thing that makes one a sincere student practitioner. The context goes much deeper than that\n\nSocial Media world is full of suggestions of \"How a Yoga practitioner should be\". We knowingly or unknowingly buy into popular ideas & try to mould ourselves accordingly, completely missing the point that the core of Yogic process is about realizing who you are & not trying to be what others say you should be or be what others are\n\nIn my understanding, a Yoga Ssdhaka is someone who lives with faith in Yoga & is committed to the Yogic process to make their mind lighter & life simpler\n\nFaith & commitment is the Key to Yoga\n\nTo go deeper in unwavering faith & unshaken commitment has been my own personal Yoga practice ethos, & it has held me in steady for the past four decades of spiritual struggle & confusion\n\nLife may not have become easy or exciting but it has surely become simpler & meaningful with it \ud83d\ude4f", "total_engagement": 1805, "engagement_rate":

is his physical strength. But I always used to wonder what was the source of his strength\n.\nAs I understood Hanuman more, I realized that his essence is not his physical strength per se, but what lies beneath it \n.\nHanunan's essence is his Bhakti, devotion to his Lord, Shri Rama. In every context of his life, Hanuman's Bhakti allowed him to get his ego out of the way. Its as if he became a nobody. When he got his ego out of the way he became the channel of the Universal Consciousness itself, which was none other than Shri Rama\n.\nChanneling the powers of Universal Consciousness by melting away one's ego through Bhakti is the lesson Hanuman's life teaches us\n.\nHis life reminds us that though we all have an animal, a monkey (mind) within, anyone can attain the heights of spiritual mastery simply through devotion and discipline\n.\nSince Yoga is the ability to control one's mind, Hanuman is also the perfect Yogi, having mastered his senses and mind solely through selfless devotion (bhakti)\n.\nHis Bhakti also makes him a perfect Karma Yogi, the one who performs his actions with detachment, selflessly, purely out of love & compassion rather than selfish motives\n.\nThus, for me, Hanuman is a perfect Yogi. He is an ideal of how Bhakti (Yoga) can flower into Karma (Yoga)\n.\nHaving perfected his mind through\u00a0Bhakti, Hanuman embodies the highest potential we can achieve if we let our ego get out of the way\n.\nMay Shri Hanuman's devotion inspire us to let our Faith eliminate our Fears\n.\nWish you an inspired Hanuman Jayanti \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe", "total_engagement": 1144, "engagement_rate":

It has to emerge from genuine self-compassion.\nBe gentle with yourself as you balm your past wounds, your resentments and hurts. \nKnow that forgiveness is the bravest act you can do for yourself, and the widest step you can cover towards yourself. \nYour act of forgiveness will let you unconditionally accept yourself for who you are and be empathetic with yourself for what you did. \nSo, treat yourself kindly, \nclose your eyes, \nbe brave, and \ngo on, do it - Forgive yourself.\nAnd then, repeat.\nKeep repeating. \n.\nHave you managed to be more compassionate with yourself over the years ?\n.\n.\n.\n#selfcompassion #forgiveness #bhaktiyoga #yogateacher", "total_engagement": 760, "engagement_rate": 0.020878547292656795, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-08T17:44:15.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "heart", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "critic", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "matter", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "standards", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "eyes", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "act", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "basis", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "step", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "anger", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "forgiveness", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "bhaktiyoga"}, {"name": "forgiveness"}, {"name": "selfcompassion"}, {"name": "yogateacher"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328838201, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:34.824Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:34.824Z"}, {"id": 607775132328838199, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "832047290", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:34.820Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:34.820Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510707, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.827Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:06.057Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510708, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.831Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:06.063Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175192645034, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqz8wURIgah/", "post_id": "3077070173512009377", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/8ffd511de49d26ac567cac7171d71a0c.JPEG", "phash": "c1506b47bd0f8735", "image_entities": [{"entity": "branch", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8087365627288818}, {"entity": "cloud", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8041250109672546}, {"entity": "morning", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6315235495567322}, {"entity": "natural landscape", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4759960472583771}, {"entity": "nature", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4009256660938263}, {"entity": "outdoors", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.365637868642807}, {"entity": "sky", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.29152241349220276}, {"entity": "sunlight", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.28703027963638306}, {"entity": "tree", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.28372710943222046}, {"entity": "bird", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.864153265953064}, {"entity": "bird", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7141427397727966}, {"entity": "bird", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7079998254776001}, {"entity": "painting", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4797895550727844}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-10T21:59:15.248Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-24T01:50:43.021Z"}}], "post_text": "For me, the essence of Easter is in knowing that we can rise above our sufferings.

In John, it is seen how much Jesus loved his people & how much he urged them to love one another, \u201cJesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world & go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.\u201d (John 13:1). \u201cA new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this, everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.\u201d (John 13:34-35)\n\nResurrection points at the immortal nature of Being. Physical death is not the end of our existence. We all are more than our embodied form. We have the power within to elevate ourselves in faith & raise ourselves to the level of immortality, as Paul mentions \u201cFor as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.\u201d (1 Corinthians 15:21-22)\n\nPeter also says, \u201che has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading..\u201d (1 Peter 1:3-4)\n\nThe gist of Christ\u2019s teachings can be presented in this beautiful quote by St. Augustine in De Magistro, he says \u201cOur real Teacher is he who is listened to, who is said to dwell in the inner man, namely Christ, that is, the unchangeable power and eternal wisdom of God\u201d\n\nSome of Christ's teaching are similar to the Upanishadic teachings.

Interestingly, it talks about Yoga as a Community endeavour even before the concept of Yoga Communities was a thing\n\nI have always believed that the future of modern Yoga will not merely be in teaching classes. Don't get me wrong, the class model is excellent, but I believe it is a door way to something bigger, i.e. its an opportunity to generate a sense of camaraderie, community, togetherness amongst fellow Yoga students\n\nA sense of Community awakens a shared sense of belonging, which I see as Bhakti\n\nEven back in the day when I used to teach classes in Mumbai the student groups had organically become a Community of sorts, most of whom are still in touch with each other though oceans apart.\n\nIn ancient times & even today in some traditional setups, the student group/s of the teachers galvanize in a Community, a Sangha. The Sangha then functions as a support system, which one relies on when the spiritual path becomes challenging\n\nSo, here is my little dream\n\n\"Each Yoga teacher, building a humble community of sincere students, guiding them as a facilitator through methods of Yoga, transforming themselves, inspiring others and in turn raising that community\u2019s awareness, where Yoga is not seen only as a practice but as a process, not only as a class but as a mindset, not only as a feel-good activity but as a life-long transformative modality\"\n\nI have dreamt of millions of such Yoga communities sprung around the world in the near future, creating hot spots of raised awareness, positivity and peace making Yoga simple and accessible\n\nMy respects and gratitude to the students and teachers who are together in this dream and are working in their own way to create such communities. This is the very ideal of Lokasangraha that the Bhagavad Gita talks about\n\nWill you dream this dream with me and wake up to achieve it ?\n\nYou may say I'm a dreamer, but (I\u2019m sure) I'm not the

When asked what they were doing, I was told that they were making a house. So, I asked them if they could build me one as well. \n\nAfter a short conversation amongst themselves they said they would make a cave for me instead. For some reason they thought a cave was more appropriate for me \ud83d\ude04\n\nSo, it was decided that I would be back in an hour or so and find my cave ready.\n\nWhat I found after coming back was one of the most intricate and innocent creation I had ever seen, a cave dug out of the earth and tastefully decorated with delicate, colourful flowers.\n\nI found a new home (cave) but lost my heart to these lil' angels in the bargain.\n\nI made 3 new friends, Naina, Sonam and Issu, for the next few days and played with them and their two cows, Gautam and Maya.\n\nSimplicity of life and innocence of heart gives joy that an overwhelmed life and a restless mind misses out on. \n\nTake time to make your hands dirty in the earth, roll around in the grass, sleep naked under the twinkling stars, climb a tree, breathe deeply, write a poem, sing with the river, dance wild in your room, laugh with your friends, and kiss a butterfly.\n\nKeep your life simple, keep your mind peaceful.\n\nYou won't

central India around 14 years ago. \n\nIt was about 4.00 p.m. A visiting Bhagat (devotee) started arranging firewood to make afternoon chai. We all were fast asleep. I heard some noise and immediately jumped up to help him with the preparations. I went to fetch water from the well as he started lighting up the Dhuna (fire pit). \n\nIt was our daily afternoon routine. Post-lunch we all would sit on the porch and talk philosophy or sing Bhajans, after which everyone would just lay on their side and take a nap. When I was not pestering Peerji (the Abbot of the monastery) with my questions or feeding the cows, I would also join them and get some rest. \n\nAs the hot Chai was being served in clay cups, one visiting Sadhu happened to burn his tongue while sipping Chai in hurry. We all laughed. Peerji gave him a stern look. Yet we all couldn\u2019t help but notice the innocent twinkle in his eye and his smirk. \n\nIt is said that a Guru never misses an opportunity to teach the student. Seizing the opportunity, Peerji recited a couplet in Awadhi language which I will try to translate. It is a dialogue between tongue and teeth. I am sure you all will enjoy it\n\n\u2018Hum battees, tu akeli, vase hamari mai,\njara bahar nikle lo, hum sau kaati jai.\u2019\n\nThe teeth say to the tongue in a condescending manner, \n\"We are 32 and you are all alone, bound by us. If you stick out even a bit, we will bite you.\"\n \nTo this the tongue replies,\n\n\"Rasana kahe dasan ko, tum kahat hain sanch, \nPar hum tedhi baath kahein, to battes pade khanch.\"\n\n\"You are right in what you say, but the moment I move in a crooked way, you all will be knocked out.\"\n\nThe wise Peerji had seized that simple incident to drive home a very important point which I want to share with y'all \n\n\u2013 strength may not always be in numbers, a single person, with clarity and confidence, can move mountains. \n\nDon't put yourself down. \nYou are strong in what you are.\nBelieve in your self.\n\nHave a good day \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\n\nPic: by me", "total_engagement": 420, "engagement_rate": 0.01153814455646823, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-18T03:51:36.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "dialogue", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tongue", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sadhu", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "chai", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "incident", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "devotee", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "afternoon chai", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "india", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "noise", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "peerji", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bhagat", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328838372, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:36.139Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:36.139Z"}, {"id": 607775132328838371, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-988288895", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:36.129Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:36.129Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510717, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.957Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:06.222Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510718, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:25.961Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:06.228Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175196660987, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CrMERIJPcpm/", "post_id": "3083858614004075110", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/b0e1c349f6c89a67897f075637a9c527.JPEG", "phash": "bf3bc896c4c96ac0", "image_entities": [{"entity": "advertisement", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9634323120117188}, {"entity": "letter", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9419780969619751}, {"entity": "brochure", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5053597688674927}, {"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34348589181900024}, {"entity": "paper", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30693677067756653}, {"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2837144434452057}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.25556254386901855}, {"entity": "flyer", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.893319308757782}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-19T02:48:54.238Z", "updated_at": "2023-07-21T09:04:25.533Z"}}], "post_text": "Starting a new series called \u2018Discomforting Conversations\u2019 to reflect upon & invite inquiry into topics & issues of Yoga industry that are not usually discussed, for whatever reason\n\nA \u2018Job Description\u2019 details main duties & responsibilities of a professional or an employee\n\nFew months ago a Yoga teacher complained to me that despite studying for 2 years in an ashram in North India, he has to teach \u2018butt workouts\u2019 & slimming modalities in class. Some weeks back another Yoga teacher told me how her Yoga classes have changed into \u2018Nervous System healing\u2019 sessions in the last 2 years. Both posed the same questions \u2013 Where is Yoga in this? \nAm I even a Yoga teacher?\n\nThe 'Yoga industry' is still in its infancy & grappling to find its identity by heavily experimenting with hybridization & trend integration. Somewhere, the strain of this experimentation is borne by the Yoga teacher\n\nAn Accounting Clerk is responsible for maintaining financial records, running reports, & recording transactions. A Sous Chef ensures nothing goes wrong in the kitchen, from ordering ingredients to keeping inventory list, ensuring cleanliness, & providing Head Chef with everything they need\n\nDo we have a clear Job Description of a Yoga Teacher in the contemporary Yoga industry? Nope!!\n\nThey have to teach asana & also guarantee \u2018good workout\u2019. They have to counsel students & also offer diet guidance. They are seen as healers, spiritual guides, therapists, care-givers, confidants & even channelers. They are expected to have knowledge of Ayurveda / Anatomy / Nutrition / Shamanism & also be an ace at Tech. They are expected to sing kirtans, guide meditations, chant Sanskrit Mantras, activate 3rd\u00a0eye, know philosophy, read Tarot & astrology charts & yes, be an activist too \u2013 all this with a serene face as if an epitome of detachment\n\nThe contemporary Yoga Teacher\u2019s Job Description is ambiguous, if not all over the place - like that of a surgeon who is expected to be anaesthetist, nurse, cook & also an ambulance driver\n\nHave you felt the overwhelm of wearing too many hats, the stress of juggling multiple roles & the confusion - \"am I even a Yoga teacher?\"",

Have you ever wondered what the difference between a Yoga Book & a Yoga Scripture (text) is?\n\nWords printed on paper that are bound together is considered a book. So, in that sense, any Yoga Scripture fulfilling the above conditions is a Book. But, qualitatively speaking, a Yoga Scripture is much more than just a bound piece of printed information\n\nYoga has been codified & presented in what is known as the Sh\u0101stra. Sh\u0101stra means \u2018the one that saves through its teaching\u2019. Thus, Yoga Sh\u0101stra are not mere texts but a compendium of knowledge specific to spiritual liberation\n\nThe Yoga Sh\u0101stras are not considered mere books in the Yogic tradition but living entities. They are so highly regarded that Adi Shankara, 9th CE, compares Sh\u0101stra to a mother who lovingly feeds & teaches her child. The Git\u0101 says that we should study the scriptures, practice what is mentioned in them & spiritually elevate ourselves. The Sh\u0101stra aims to guide, educate & motivate the seekers to facilitate their own liberation.\n\nThere are thousands of Yoga scriptures written over thousands of years. They are not haphazard in order. Different texts present knowledge at a different level of maturity & are to be studied depending on one's maturity. One can segregate Yogic scriptures (Sh\u0101stra) into three types,\n\n\u2022 Scriptures that present only the theory, \n\u2022 the ones that explain only techniques/practices &, \n\u2022 the ones that present both, theory & practice\n\nHere are three points that can help you navigate your Scriptural study (Sw\u0101dhy\u0101ya)\n\n1)\u00a0Do not just read through a Yogic text like a novel. Study it, practice what\u2019s given in it patiently, & reflect on its content to contemplate deeply on your self & your life \n\n2)\u00a0Study the Yogic texts with a teacher, at least initially, because the symbolism, grammar, contexts & interpretation could be misconstrued\n\n3) Handle & treat the Yogic scriptures (even in form of printed books or e-books) with regard, respect & humility,\u00a0as if you would treat a person. This is why in India the students don\u2019t touch a book with their feet or sit on a book or use it as a Yoga prop. Yoga texts in form of books are considered Goddess Saraswati herself", "total_engagement": 459, "engagement_rate": 0.012609543693854565, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at":

So, here goes... \n\nWell, the answer is not a simple Yes or No,  because Indian culture is very complex\n\nThe word \u2018Namaste\u2019, pronounced \u2018nuh+muh+stey\u2019, originates in Sanskrit but is mainly used only in a few North Indian regions. Most of India does NOT say Namaste. (Note: India has 121 major & 1600 minor languages) \n\nOther regions use variants like Namaskar, Namo Namaha, Namaskara, Namaskaram etc\n\nEtymologically, Namaste means \n\u201cmy respectful obeisance to you\u201d\nNama\u1e25 = respectful obeisance & te = to you \n\n\u2018Namaste\u2019 is NOT just a word, its a practice comprising 3 parts \n\u2022 the spoken word\n\u2022 the gesture (joining hands/bowing head/genuflecting/touching feet/prostrating) \n\u2022 the intention\n\nIntention is the main part, without which saying or doing Namaste is mere tokenism \n\nThrough Namaste or its variants we convey the intention of honoring the other, human or non-human. In India, especially in temples & rituals, we \u2018Namaste\u2019 to children, Elephants, Cows & Rats too, & NOT only elders\n\nThe practice of Namaste is a beautiful practice that reminds us to honor the formless Divine behind the physical form\n\nSome must have seen Thai Airways Flight Staff do a Namaste gesture & greet passengers on board \u2013 I love this practice & immediately feel welcomed \n\nColloquially, Namaste has become a casual greeting amongst Hindi speakers & could be equated to a Hello or a Bye. Many do it as a token, tradition, or as a socio-cultural norm. Yet, the term still carries its original intent\n\nIn my mother language (Marathi) we say \u2018Namaskar\u2019 instead of\u00a0Namaste, when we meet someone, say bye, when we start a letter, when we sign off a note - the aim is to convey the intention. The same with 'Namaste'\n\nLooking at the rising intolerance, trolling & cancel-culture in our society I think we all need some TLC through a heartfelt, sincere Namaste (or its variants)\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nImagine if we all sincerely meant \u201cI offer my respectful obeisance to you\u201d & consciously reminded ourselves of the divinity behind everyone we encounter, how peaceful our world would be? \n\nPls Share\n\nNamaste\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd", "total_engagement": 3762, "engagement_rate": 0.10334880909865114, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-26T12:39:28.000Z",

Almost every day I receive messages or emails from teachers around the world expressing this feeling\n\nThough the term has gained traction in recent years the context has been discussed by Maharishi Patanjali in his Yoga Sutra a couple of centuries ago. Even the Bhashyakars (traditional commentators) have elaborated on it over two millenia\n\nPatanjali talks about \u2018Samshaya\u2019 - doubtful thoughts, that emerge due to our ignorance of what is. One traditional commentator called Bhoja Raja says Samshaya is about doubting the practice of Yoga itself. In the same Sutra, Patanjali talks about Bhranti Darshana, delusional perception. Shankaracharya says Bhranti Darshana is having misconceptions about one\u2019s Yoga practice. [PYS 1:30]\n\nApart from the above, Patanjali also mentions a type of Vritti (conception) called Viparyaya, i.e false knowledge \u2013 a kind of mental state which is far removed from the right knowledge of things [PYS 1:8]\n\nThus, all throughout the Yoga Sutra Patanjali has indicated the experience of what we know nowadays call \u2018The Imposter Syndrome\u2019\n\nSo, how can we handle Imposter Syndrome from Patanjali\u2019s view?\n\nPatanjali would say that the Imposter Syndrome is based in our primal ignorance of our True Nature, Avidya. To remove it, we need to work on our fundamental misconception of Self\n\nInorder to work on it we need to gradually work on making our mind one-pointed [PYS 1:32] & this can happen only by Abhyasa (consistent, long-term practice) & Vairagya (detachment) [PYS 1:12]\n\nThis is how, the model of Patanjali's Yoga is as relevant as it was back then", "total_engagement": 1270, "engagement_rate": 0.03488915139693964, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-28T16:58:06.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "qualifications & experience of study & teaching", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "task performance &", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& undeserving", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thoughts", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "maharishi patanjali", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga teacher", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328838565, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:38.392Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:38.392Z"}, {"id": 607775132328838564, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1202433613", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:38.385Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:38.385Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510731, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:26.273Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:06.535Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510732, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:26.281Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:06.546Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175199526053, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CrnpSPvoSkb/", "post_id": "3091621242975889691", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/b13e4cf3b8724262b9de73df2d763be8.JPEG", "phash": "ea9595489bc2b5f0", "image_entities": [{"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6444386839866638}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.35639193654060364}, {"entity": "flyer", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4867337644100189}, {"entity": "animal", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24838463962078094}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-05-04T01:23:52.306Z", "updated_at": "2023-07-21T09:08:14.540Z"}}], "post_text": "In the popular Yoga culture we have heard that Maharishi Patanjali defines Asana as \u2018Sthira & Sukha\u2019 - or that\u2019s the part that gets most attention\n\nFor some reason, the term \u2018Sthira\u2019 has come to be seen as \u2018Perfection\u2019 of a pose, demanding years of effort, along with the stress, dejection, injuries & burnout that comes with chasing perfection. The performative postural Yoga stance too pumps up this drive.The Bodybuilding adage \u2018No Pain, No Gain\u2019 has quietly filtered into the practice ethos of some modern Yoga asana \u2018styles\u2019 over the past decades\n\nBut, does Patanjali ask us to push our efforts and strive in Asana?\n\nNo, in fact, he states exactly the opposite. He asks us to relax the effort or the exertion\n\nFor Patanjali, Asana is a steady postural seat, taken to facilitate subtler practices like Pranayama (2:49)\n\nHe says, Asana becomes Sthira & Sukha \u2013 Steady & Comfortable (or agreeable) only by dropping effort & absorbing thoughts into the infinite\n\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u0924\u094d\u0928\u0936\u0948\u0925\u093f\u0932\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0938\u092e\u093e\u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092d\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u094d\u00a0\u0965\u096a\u096d\u0965\nprayatna-\u015baithilya-ananta-sam\u0101pattibhy\u0101m ||2:47||\n\nDropping the effort or strain then is a crucial component of Asana without which the Asana would not be able to facilitate further subtler practices like Pranayama, because a striving mind cannot be channeled towards a steady-state (Ekagra Chitta)\n\nA strained, effortful body, that is continuously in a heightened state of arousal, just cannot facilitate subtler practices \n\nThe Vyasa Bhashya, the most important commentary on Yoga Sutra, says - Effortlessness stops the body from being shaky. Such effortless steadiness of Asana is called Asanajaya, or, mastery of Asana in Yoga Sutra (Vyasa Bhashya 2:48)\n\nThere's a thin line between dedicated effort and obsessive exertion, and that thin line is of patience\n\nThis is why the Yoga Sadhaka needs to be acutely self-aware during Asana & consciously work on making the Asana joyful and effortless\n\nHow do you cultivate effortlessness in your own Asana sadhana ?\n\nShare with your friends \ud83d\udc95", "total_engagement": 1611, "engagement_rate": 0.04425702590588171, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-29T12:06:33.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "reason", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "burnout", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "term", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sukha", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& absorbing thoughts", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "effort", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sthira", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "part", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "maharishi patanjali", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "steady & comfortable", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sthira & sukha", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Beauty & Fitness", "confidence": 0.9944644570350647}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328838613, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:38.623Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:38.623Z"}, {"id": 607775132328838611, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "989190931", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:38.618Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:38.618Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510733, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:26.308Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:06.577Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510734, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:26.314Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:06.599Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175199526035, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CrqRy2mI9N9/", "post_id": "3092362355529732989", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/094cf720a372e58771d97f390f511889.JPEG", "phash": "c0943b6a2d2b671f", "image_entities": [{"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9767158627510071}, {"entity": "line", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.44213682413101196}, {"entity": "brand", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4009319841861725}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.28297361731529236}, {"entity": "flyer", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6739006638526917}, {"entity": "candle", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.32695814967155457}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-05-04T01:23:52.631Z", "updated_at": "2023-07-21T09:08:03.538Z"}}], "post_text": "As Yoga teachers, we love our analogies, imageries, hyperboles, our \u2018breathe through your feet\u2026, our \u2018melt your body into the floor...\u2019 and all that \u2013 don\u2019t we? \ud83d\ude0a I am sure we take it with a pinch of salt, and let it pass\n\nBut what happens when Absolute Statements are used for spiritual bypassing?\n\nThere is a hazard of getting carried away by absolute statements like \u201cwe are all consciousness\u201d, \u201cthere is nothing to do\u201d, \"it\u2019s all here and now\", \u201ceverything is love\u201d, \"its all Oneness\" etc., without keeping the context in mind\n \nIn modern spirituality we are surrounded by quotes. Spiritual Quotes do help us stay motivated. But, transferring statements made by mystics from their absolute states onto our present reality to escape self-work is an act of self-delusion\n \nThe Upanishadic teachings clearly state that between the Guru telling the disciple \u201cTat Tvam Asi\u201d - You are THAT, and the disciple experientially proclaiming \u201cAham Brahma Asmi\u201d - I am THAT, lies an intense journey of hard work, sacrifice, detachment, anxiety & doubt that continuously tests our faith, resilience, surrender, patience & clarity. \n\nArjuna had to go through the grind even though he had, literally, the Supreme God, as his best friend\n\nYoga is NOT a path of Spiritual bypassing\n\nYes, it is indeed enchanting to bathe in quotes of J. Krishnamurthy, Buddha, Ramana Maharishi, or Rumi. Their words do inspire us.\n\nBut the reason for this post is - over the years, I have met way too many who take these statements literally & completely lose connection with their subjective reality.\n\u00a0\nOur troubles are not due to Absolute reality, God, True Self, whatever you call it. It's the mundane, the day-to-day transactional reality, that tests us & challenges us\n\nUsing Absolute ideas, to avoid challenges of self-growth, is an act of self-denial\n\nTry to figure out how to rise above the entrapments of transactional reality. Your personal Sadhana & your trust will help in this pursuit.\n\nWhen you can stabilize your mind in the seemingly contradictory experiences & triggers of day-to-day life, you will naturally experience the steadiness of Absolute within.\n\nPlease Share \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd", "total_engagement": 2072, "engagement_rate": 0.05692151314524326, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at":

For a 8 year old boy it was exciting & intriguing to explore movements of the body, plays of the mind & relish the inner calm. It was my first Yoga Course, & my sister and I were the only kids amongst all adult participants, yet we never felt out of place in the group. \n.\nYoga scene in India back then was completely different. Yoga training at the school where I studied was inclusive, holistic & taught with a goal of holistic wellbeing & self-knowledge. This ethos still reflects in my teachings\n.\nI could say that it truly was a Yoga training & not an Asana training\n.\nIn retrospect, I have tried to recall how my training looked back then & made a list of some points that may interest you. Here they are,\n.\n\u2022 Asanas were taught as a self-experience & not as an exercise\n\u2022 The teachers showed us what to do & let us discover the Asana ourselves under strict supervision.\n\u2022 The instructions were minimal\n\u2022 There was no pulling, tugging or pushing by the teacher \n\u2022 The general ambience in the teaching hall was cheerful, encouraging & very supporrive of each other. As an anxious kid I felt safe in the course\n\u2022 There was never a class without start & end chant, Pranayama, Shavasana & Dhyana \n\u2022 The Teacher ended the class with a spiritual talk or quote from Yogic scriptures with a brief explanation\n\u2022 We were encouraged to practice at home & were given handouts\n\u2022 We were all respectful towards the teachers, beyond age & gender, not out of force but out of a regard for their knowledge & experience\n.\nThrough ups and downs of my life Yoga has always been with me. I am growing with Yoga & Yoga keeps growing on me. Here's to many more years with Yoga \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n.\nI want to thank my Mom for having the sense to know where to direct her children's energy at that age. \nThank you Aai \u2764",

the classes we teach. In a way it helps us improve. But, many times we don\u2019t get the expected response & this can beat our confidence\n\nOur Yogic self-work then is to gradually lessen our dependence on external validation & channel our efforts toward generating inner clarity instead\n \nSharing a slice of my life, especially for the new Yoga Teachers here\n\nSo, 20 years ago, in May 2003, I was invited to speak at an International Fitness Convention in Germany. I was to deliver 3 lectures & demos\n\nI was double nervous because it was my first International Workshop & I was the only presenter from Asia.There was a lot at stake. I was used to teaching groups but teaching at this level was nerve wracking\n\nMy first presentation was on Aquatic Methods of Relaxation\n\nAfter delivering my presentation, which I thought went well, I waited upon the participants to come & talk to me as any presenter would\n\nThe participants slowly started coming out of the pool & walking towards me. The first person who came up to me smirked & said, \u201cwho made you a speaker?\u201d, the next one said, \u201cI wasted my money\u201d, the third lady said, \u201cboy, you have lots to learn\u201d, the fourth one was visibly unhappy & said, \u201cyou do not get a good feedback review from me\u201d, the one next stomped out saying, \u201cyou are not coming to the conference next year for sure\u201d\n\nSoon, I saw the rest walking away without even acknowledging me. My mind went numb, I impulsively started to laugh out of confusion & shock. I couldn\u2019t make sense of anything that was going on\n\nI quickly picked up my bag & ran out of the premises towards a green patch some distance away, trying to figure what the heck had just happened\n\nMy mind was blank, in shock. My eyes were foggy, my heart was racing & my spirits defeated\n\nI sat under a tree to let the feeling fade away, trying to process it all & calm down. Those few minutes on that green patch of grass were some of the most precious moments that have contributed to my self-clarity, something that I still carry in my heart\n\u00a0\nFriends, we all have our journeys\nDon\u2019t give up on yourself\nWe don't fail, we only learn\nLet your clarity show you the way \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe", "total_engagement": 1574, "engagement_rate":

student @yunyogaportrait during a workshop on Bhakti Yoga, 5 years ago in HongKong\n\nLook how the projection of letters has fallen on my body. Coincidently, that time I was mentioning how the Tantra mentions that the human body holds 52 sounds from the Sanskrit alphabet \n\nIn Indian culture, the \u2018Word\u2019 (Shabda), along with sounds, language & grammar has always played an important part, both in the Vedic & the Tantric traditions\n\nIn fact, many may not know that Patanjali has written extensively on language, grammar, sense & meaning. Tantric Philosophers like\u00a0Bhartrahari\u00a0have even developed spiritual philosophies revolving around language, called\u00a0Shabda advaita\u00a0\u2013 linguistic non-dualism\n\nEach letter is considered a Goddess. There is a group of Goddesses called the seven Mother Goddesses (Saptam\u0101trik\u0101) that correspond to the seven consonant groups in Sanskrit language\n\nIn Tantra, the seven M\u0101trik\u0101s (Goddesses) are said to be the guardians of the embodied self. All 52 Goddesses (more or less) are seated within the human body. When we chant a Bija or a Mantra, we are not only creating sound through our mouth but also manifesting a vibrational super-structure Matrix & waking up the Goddesses. Invoking Goddesses has a direct implication on our cognitive reality & perception\n\nThis is how sound, in the form of letters, is seen as a medium of communication, expression & interaction of ideas, emotions & beliefs\n\nDeep within the belly of every letter, ( M\u0101trik\u0101, Vibrational Goddess) there is a potent meaning & sense waiting to be deciphered. This sense is called \u2018Bh\u0101va\u2019\n\nHinduism considers that the world is divided into manifest & the unmanifest, thought of as sound & silence\n\nSilence always underlines everything that is spoken, & this is why the highest speech is considered to be that which brings sound back to silence\n\nRetracting speech into silence & making the mind still is essence of Mantra Yoga\n\nThe scriptures state that when the mind\u2019s noise is quietened, the sound of silence is heard. This sound of silence is the primal N\u0101da, the Om, from which the word & world emerges & in which it dissolves", "total_engagement": 326, "engagement_rate": 0.008955797917639625, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-13T17:12:59.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "matrix &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "workshop", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "body", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "grammar", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sense & meaning tantric philosophers", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sense", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "interaction", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reality &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "vedic & the tantric", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thought of as", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "manifest & the unmanifest", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "language", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "language & grammar", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sounds", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "pictures", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "meaning &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "emotions &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "letters", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "expression &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tantra", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "everything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sound &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "yunyogaportrait"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328838693, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:39.647Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:39.647Z"}, {"id": 607775132328838691, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1970106103", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:39.640Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:39.640Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510743, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:26.450Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:06.800Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510744, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:26.457Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:06.827Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175203535459, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CsOLICLv11j/", "post_id": "3102466123916860771", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "Few weeks ago, I was told my posts are \u2018edgy\u2019, but in a good way, because they invite deeper reflection\n\nThe tone of my writing is thanks to my spiritual teachers. Fortunately, none of them let me get away with an unexamined idea. They would cut my ideas short with the sharpest\u00a0counter-argument based on logic & scriptural testimony. It was not easy being their student, & I say it with gratitude \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n\nOnce, I worked on an inquiry for over a year & went to my teacher thinking he would be impressed.

There is an entire science of reasoning in Indic tradition called Tarka Sh\u0101stra, just like there is the science of Yoga, Yoga Sh\u0101stra\n\nTarka is the process of inquiring & reasoning ideas to arrive at a conclusion.It\u2019s an important tool & study subject in all traditions i.e Hindu, Buddhist & Jain\n\nTarka is essential to Yoga, because it helps filter through baseless ideas & fanciful beliefs that are neither rooted in experience nor in scriptural testimony\n\nThough it\u2019s a complex subject, I think modern practitioners would benefit from some of its basic tenets to help clear confusion, esp. these days when anything passes off as Yoga\n\nOver past 100 years, as Yoga became more about health & wellbeing, the focus of study shifted from learning systematic inquiry & reasoning to doing physical practices\n\nAlso, for some reason, logic & analysis is perceived as an enemy of spirituality, in turn emphasizing matters of the \u2018Heart\u2019.But, in Yogic tradition, critical thinking is essential to sharpen the faith. Faith & Reason are NOT enemies in Yoga. Logic & reflection purifies mind & unblocks the \u2018Spiritual Heart\u2019.Only a mind thus purified anchors deeply in faith & surrenders without doubt\n\nThe reason why I've paused my Teacher Trainings since 4 years is that I am reworking the curriculum & plan to include basics of Yogic critical inquiry in it\nLet's see how it shapes up", "total_engagement": 1057, "engagement_rate": 0.029037663800445042, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-14T11:13:24.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "faith & reason", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "logic & analysis", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga logic & reflection", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "inquiring & reasoning", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "testimony", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& study", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "logic & scriptural", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "systematic inquiry & reasoning", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "buddhist & jaintarka", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "idea", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tool", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "student", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "none", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "writing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thanks", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "year", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reflection", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tone", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "posts", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "beliefs", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "subject", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teachers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ideas", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teacher", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "health & wellbeing", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328838709, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:39.895Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:39.895Z"}, {"id": 607775132328838707, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1018459182", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:39.885Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:39.885Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510745, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:26.483Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:06.849Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510746, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:26.487Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:06.856Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175203535455, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CsOs-Ccvqwe/", "post_id": "3102614970588638238", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": "Naarden-Bussum", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "Friends in The Netherlands\nHere is my teaching schedule, close to Amsterdam\n\nDoing a day workshop on the 4th June\nBreath of Life -

They are like the two wings of a Yoga practitioner\n\nAbhy\u0101sa, as practice, is recognized as important in popular Yoga, because Yoga itself is seen as practice\n\nBut, Vair\u0101gya, as detachment, is either ignored or dumbed down because it is considered scary or impossible\n\nOne more reason why Vair\u0101gya has not gained traction in modern spirituality is economics. Abhy\u0101sa, as practice, fills up the revenue streams. We buy stuff to practice Yoga. But Vair\u0101gya, as detachment, is counter productive to spiritual consumerism\n\nVair\u0101gya comes across as scary because its usualy perceived as giving up everything & going away to the Himalayas, far from friends & family. Seekers are afraid of losing the charm of life. But such romanticized notions are erroneous\n\nVair\u0101gya, as non-attachment, doesn\u2019t mean \u201cgiving up\u201d of everything, rather, it is about giving up of specific things that are not any more conducive for self-growth (\u0100tmajn\u0101na)\n\nVair\u0101gya in Yoga is neither random nor impulsive. What exactly to give up is known through self-clarity. Such clarity is called Viveka. Thus, Viveka preceeds Vairagya, & are complimentary practices\n\nNon-attachment is like lifting off one foot from the lower step to climb the higher step.Unless one is ready to detach from the lower step how will one advance to the next?\n\nIf you find it difficult to detach from something, make sure to examine the intensity of your attachment to it. Unless we detach from the old & unproductive, we won\u2019t be able to embrace the new & the positive\n\nAlso, Vair\u0101gya is not a one-time activity. It is a lifelong process of lightning up. The entire asht\u0101nga yoga is based in Vair\u0101gya. There can be no Yoga without it\n\nBe clear about your priorities, realise what doesnt serve you anymore, know what to let go of, be trusting enough to detach from it, & be adventurous enough to embrace the new\n\nDetachment is challenging, but surely well worth the realization it brings\n\nAnd, if you are still afraid of Vair\u0101gya, know that what you can drop is NOT really you & the true You can never be dropped\n\nLet go of the old & make space for the new, your True Self awaits YOU\n\nPls Share \ud83d\ude4f", "total_engagement": 1361, "engagement_rate": 0.03738908271750776,

My upcoming Europe tour has factored in the variable of exhaustion already.\n\nThis article from The Guardian states,\n\"A survey has found that tiredness is why 35% of people don\u2019t make the changes to their diet and physical activity levels that would help them close the gap between good intentions and concrete action.\"\n\nOver the last 4 years or so, it has become very clear to me that, professionally, I am dealing with a society of physically tired & mentally exhausted individuals that prefer Yoga as a quick fix, feel-good modality & not as a lifelong pursuit of self-transformation.This is because long-term pursuits feel overwhelming. People prefer excitational highs over consistent increments.\n\nYes, Yoga makes us feel good and at times quick fixes do help, but that doesn't have to make us reduce the holsitic lifelong pursuit of Yoga to an instant gratifying commodity. Yes, it is important to meet the students where they are at and give them what they need, but this needs to be done without compromising the grand narrative in which Yoga is rooted.\n\nYoga teachers will agree that this is indeed a tough terrain to navigate, a professional challenge I've accepted to take head on. \n\nWhat gives me confidence is the knowledge that the discomfort between Shreya (holstic growth) versus Preya (instant gratification) has been discussed even by the Upanishads. So, it is not a new problem as such.\n\nIt is this very exhaustion and overwhelm that doesnt let us stick to our S\u0101dhana. Even Patanjali talks about it in his discussion of the Antar\u0101ya.\n\nSo, Yoga teachers, care givers, coaches, educators, parents, please read the article. It is an eye opener. This is the ecosystem of the new 'normal' that we have to operate in as Yoga Teachers.\n\nSo, if you are exhausted, first help yourself. \nIf you have found a balance, help others help themselves.\n\nLet me know in comments \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc\n\u2022 How do you manage your own exhaustion & motivate your exhausted students to commit to long term practice

"media": [], "post_text": "As modern Yoga discourse borrows from different religio-cultural narratives, & as gas-lighting & cancel culture becomes commonplace in social media, many Yoga teachers & seekers have come to feel that there is something essentially wrong with them\n\nThe worst part is, in my conversations & counselings with numerous practitioners I've found that many have been told/taught that according to Yoga we are \u2018ignorant\u2019, & that our vulnerabilities are imperfections, because of which we need to transform ourselves using Yoga\n\nMy heart breaks for those who have bought into this flawed narrative of Yoga that makes them feel as if they are fundamentally flawed \n\nIs there any truth to such narrative in Yogic tradition that devalues personal agency?\n\nLast month I taught the most essential Sankhya scripture, called Sankhya Karika. One of the main point in it states, \u2018The Purusha is never really bound\u2019, i.e. the misidentification of Consciousness with matter is NOT absolute but apparent. In simple terms, the individual (Purusha) was, is, & will always be Purse Consciousness (Chetan) despite what the mind makes it believe\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita too states that \u2018God\u2019, as Universal Consciousness (Parabrahma), is seated in the hearts of all beings. No matter how deeply limited an individual is, due to circumstances or capabilities, all will merge into the Universal Consciousness eventually because the essential nature of Individual & Universal is the SAME. Advaita Vedanta tells us, Atman = Brahman. The Upanishads too boldly proclaim, \u2018YOU are the child of immortality\u2019 (Shvetashvatara Upanishad). Hundreds of such examples from the Yogic texts ask us to be hopeful, be trusting, & do our self-work (Sadhana) to keep growing in our understanding of our Self\n\nHuman (or any sentient being for that matter) is neither fundamentally flawed nor existentially faulty. Yogic wisdom of Upanishad says, \"This Self (Atman) is Infinite (Brahman)\" (Mandukya Upanishad)\n\nDear Friends, do not feel less about yourself. Yoga does NOT say you are flawed. Yoga does NOT claim your vulnerabilities are imperfections.

He did his Arati (prayers) for 30 mins in a peculiar way. He would raise his heels, squat slowly till his hip touched the heels & rise up fast. He did hundreds of repetitions while chanting his prayers holding a heavy 5 kilo ghee lamp. He told me that in his monastery, which was located in Dang district in interiors of Nepal, they prayed in Utkatiasana as a form of Tapas (bodily challenge) to reduce identification with the physical body\n\nIn pre-modern Hatha tradition, such dynamic squats are called Utkatasana / Utkatiasana.These days its often called chair pose - which is fine as an anology, but I feel it dilutes its deeper sense & makes it purely physical\n\nIn Sanskrit, prefix \u2018Ut\u2019 or \u2018Ud\u2019 means upward, & \u2018Kata\u2019 means to go, or a mat. Thus, Utkatasana literally means \u2018going upward\u2019 or \u2018moving up, off the mat\u2019\n\nThough scriptural instructions differ, practitioners are often asked to raise heels during eccentric phase\n\nOne benefit of Utkatasana in oral Hatha tradition is that it helps in \u2018reversing the flow\u2019 of Apana Vayu. The pre-modern Hatha Yogis take their \u2018reverse\u2019 & \u2018inverted\u2019 practices very seriously\n\nIt is said that reversal of Apana Vayu (i.e Prana flowing downward) helps in pushing Kundalini upward, into the Sushumna\n\nThough everything doesnt have to be complimentary between Hatha anatomy & bio-medical anatomy, I see a parallel in the \u2018reversal of downward flow' or the 'going upward\u2019 narrative\n\nAnatomically, heel raised squats strengthen the Calf muscles, esp. anterior, lateral, & deep posterior compartment, thus helping pump venous blood up toward the heart more efficiently (thus 'reverse flow').\nThis is why Calf muscles are called 2nd Heart. The verticle flow has 2 components, centripetal flow during contraction & centrifugal flow during relaxation of Calf that creates pressure changes\n\nIssues of foot, ankle, calf, knee, thigh, or network of veins in legs, may lead to impairment of calf muscle pump & reduce venous return\n\nThis is how, Utkatasana could work to \u2018reversing downward flow' in both, traditional & bio-medical sense\n\nPls Share", "total_engagement": 1806, "engagement_rate": 0.04961402159281338, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-21T11:17:32.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328838904, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:41.907Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:41.907Z"}, {"id": 607775132328838903, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "648305362", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:41.903Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:41.903Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510761, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:26.727Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.132Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510762, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:26.737Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.156Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175207750359, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Csi0IT_vybo/", "post_id": "3108275962484041448", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "Yesterday was World Meditation Day. Here are some common Meditation Myths. Note, here the term Meditation is understood as the process of Yogic Dhy\u0101na\n\n1) Meditation is about emptying the mind: \nNo, in fact, Dhy\u0101na is about first calming down the mind & then focusing the mind completely. Working with an idea of \u2018emptying the mind\u2019 can actually be overwhelming & discouraging, especially in early stages of practice when we realise how full our mind actually is\n\n2) Meditation is only possible in lotus position:  No, the primary instruction for meditation posture in Yogic scriptures is that the head, neck & torso should be held straight (Gita) & steady position of comfortable ease (Yoga Sutra). One can choose to sit on chair, couch or floor. Avoid lying down as it may put you to sleep. Meditation is about the state of mind, when body is comfortable & mind is at ease\n\n3) Meditate for an hour a day:  No, don't have to. It can begin with short sessions & the time can be gradually increased. One can start with sitting still for 15 mins, increasing a minute a week. Remember, the quality of meditation in terms of the state of mind it generates is more important than the time spent in sitting position\n\n4) Meditation is about chanting in a language you don't understand: No, meditation can be done using varied \u2018holding points\u2019 (\u0101lambana) that include breath, visualisation, images & even sensations. If you choose to meditate with a Mantra, see to it that you resonate with the Mantra, you know its meaning, the correct way of pronunciation, method of chanting, & follow the prescribed practices that are associated with chanting a Mantra\n\n5) My mind is not quiet enough for meditation, so I don't do it: We find it tough to calm down the mind, but that\u2019s exactly why one should start meditation journey. Dhy\u0101na is long, gradual & layered process that starts with sensory-cognitive regulation & ends in Sam\u0101dhi. Calming & steadying the mind takes long time & needs to be supplimented by lifestyle regulation, trust, discipline & detachment\n\nSo, don\u2019t judge yourself, don\u2019t compete, & don'r rush \u2013 just practice. Gradually, over years, mind will calm down & focus (ek\u0101gra). \nBe patient \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd", "total_engagement": 772, "engagement_rate": 0.021208208565698744, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-22T11:36:30.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328838920, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:42.057Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:42.057Z"}, {"id": 607775132328838919, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "194444231", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:42.052Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:42.052Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510763, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:26.776Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.176Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510764, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:26.788Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.188Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175207750304, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cslgedoobx3/", "post_id": "3109033948662054007", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "A Facebook memory from 11 years ago, about something that I truly believe in\n\nI see every Yoga class as an opportunity to bring rest, relaxation, rehabilitation and realization in the life of class participants\n\nIn this sense, each Yoga class taught with sincere intention, humble mindset and a holistic view becomes a portal of transformation over a period of time\n\nWhichever aspect of Yoga you may be teaching, asana, pranayama, dhyana, chanting, or philosophy \u2013 know that it has power to bring positivity, hope, calm & comfort to you & to the lives of people reaching out to you.

I've heard such statements innumerable times\n\nWhen Yoga is reduced to a purely physical project, mindfulness becomes something separate \n\nBut, it doesnt have to be that way. Yoga & mindfulness are NOT different practices per se. Neither is mindfulness solely a \u2018Buddhist\u2019 practice, but that topic for some other time \n\nYoga is practice & mindfulness is the way the practice is done. The basis of Yoga is in mindfulness. Without being mindful, there can be no Yoga \ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffd\n\nOn the internet, Mindfulness is defined as the practice of being aware and/or focusing attention. In this sense, the entire practice of Yoga is based in mindfulness\n\nNote, when I say Yoga I do not mean Asana only, but an entire process of self-transformation to realize the True-Self within\n\nHere are just a few points on how traditional Yoga is & has always been a practice of mindfulness,\n\n1) When Patanjali says, \u2018Yoga is cessation of mental fluctuations\u2019 \u2013 he is speaking to those practitioners who are mindful of their own mental fluctuations (chittavritti)\n\n2) When Krishna asks us to do our actions without attachment (Gita 5:11) \u2013 he is intending it as a mindfulness practice\n\n3) Krishna also asks us to be mindful of our sleep, activity, food habits and recreation (Gita 6:16), this too is a practice of mindful living\n\n4) Pratyahara, as a process in Yoga, is all about turning the mind inward by being mindful of sensory input\n\n5) When Uddalaka tells his son Shvetaketu in Chandogya Upanishad (6.8.7), Tat tvam asi, \u2018You are That\u2019, he is asking him to be mindful of his inner nature\n\n6) When Svatmarama asks Hatha Yogis to practice Pranayama with \u2018sattvik buddhi\u2019 (2.6), he is indicating an undisturbed mindful state of awareness\n\nWhat is important is to appreciate the fact that Yoga is an attempt to realize (become mindful of) our True-Nature (Atman) that we have forgotten due to mis-identification (Avidya).\n\nIn this sense, Yoga, from its core premise, is truly a mindfulness practice & not something seperate from it. There can be no Yoga without mindfulness\n\nShare with friends & help bring clarity to this topic \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\n\n#mindfulness #yogabeyondposes", "total_engagement": 1075, "engagement_rate": 0.029532155710007967, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-25T12:59:30.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328839099, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:42.817Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:42.817Z"}, {"id": 607775132328839095, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-418488037", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:42.804Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:42.804Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510769, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:26.896Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.291Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510770, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:26.908Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.299Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175207750170, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CsrLVZ5Bf0m/", "post_id": "3110629817050332454", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/171d602108e9026d5ea8118b5f92ab49.JPEG", "phash": "e8499f3c4894cd6d", "image_entities": [{"entity": "sitting", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5671951174736023}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2100829929113388}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9464167952537537}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8950487375259399}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8294960260391235}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8019983172416687}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7761600017547607}, {"entity": "jeans", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.40113216638565063}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3920588195323944}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-05-28T01:24:26.484Z", "updated_at": "2023-07-21T09:10:36.578Z"}}], "post_text": "When someone we care about is \ud83d\ude47\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0fstruggling, it can be challenging to know how to help.

The pressure of wanting to be perfect, especially with regards to the shape of the body, precision of poses, mental states & Yogiclifestyle shows on many Yoga Teachers, especially the new ones. Chasing perfection is exhausting - I am sure we know this. So, here's  something about it,\n\nYoga is not about becoming perfect, because the Being (\u0101tman) is already perfect according to the Yogic understanding. One can't become what one already is ...\n\nThe body, poses, behaviour, emotion, morality, are all transient, & whatever is transient cannot have lasting perfection according to the Yogic view.\n\nYour asana will never be perfect always, your body will never have an ideal state, because the mind-body complex keeps changing as it responds to the process called life.\n\nSo, what to do then?\n\nFocus on being sincere to the Process, instead of being rattled by ideas of Perfection.\n\nA little child is not an imperfect adult, it is a child. A tiny sprout is not an imperfect tree, it is a sprout. You, as a Yoga practitioner, are not an imperfect Yogin, you are a Yogin in process.\n\nLets get this straight.

I said goodbye to everyone at home &, as per tradition, touched my mother\u2019s feet for her blessings. She was sitting next to the picture of her recently ailed husband. I hugged her, gave her a kiss. She said all the best, wished me luck. I rolled my bag, stepped out of the door waiting for the elavator to come up. Then, something deep inside my heart pulled me back in saying \"go, hug her once again\" \u2013 I rushed & sat at her feet holding her hand silently. This was unlike me, so she asked \u2013 is everything okay? Hearing me not say anything, she said, \"don\u2019t worry, I will be fine. All the best\". Hugging her tightly, with a numb mind & a heavy heart, I stepped out straight for the airport\n\nOn 27th May 2012, I got a frantic call from my sister during my Yoga workshop in Holland. She said I had to fly back home as mom had slipped into Coma. Emotionally broken, I flew home with dramatic expectation that hearing my voice she would come out of Coma, but nothing like that happened. Two days later, she left her body. It will be 11 years tomorrow since her passing\n\nThe opportunity to see & hug her one last time before I left comforted me through my grief. I have nothing but gratitude for all that my mother & father gave my siblings & I. But, their passing also taught me the value of not holding on to grudges, resentment & regrets \n\nOur time here is short. We all will be subjected to discomfort, disease, decay & eventual death. This is the Truth of our embodied existence\n\nSo, do NOT hold grudges. Lighten the heaviness of your past & refrain from gnawing at your wounds. Settle your disputes, forgive, make closures & gradually wipe your mental slates clean. Only then will your heart fill with Love, Love that is free of conditions, Love that is empowering. It takes courage to do this, but this is exactly what Yoga practice is all about\n\nThe successive death of my father & mother within a short span of 3 months has been the most spiritual experience of my life. It left a big hole in my life, but also made me confront the reality of Death & reflect on the nature of Life. In their loss, I found mySelf\n\nThank You Aai & Baba", "total_engagement": 969, "engagement_rate": 0.026620147798137414, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-28T11:37:24.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "heart", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "see", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "feet", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "truth", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "husband", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "death of", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mom", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hand", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "picture", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mother & father", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "everyone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "europe", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "luck", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tradition", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tour", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "kiss", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "home", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rushed", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "grudges", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "everything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "best", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "closures & gradually wipe", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "siblings &", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& hug", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "resentment & regrets", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "disease decay & eventual death", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mind", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nothing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "blessings", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328839221, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:43.816Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:43.816Z"}, {"id": 607775132328839220, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1431082448", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:43.810Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:43.810Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510777, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:27.040Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.435Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510778, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:27.046Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.443Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175211884389, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs1D-cPIgom/", "post_id": "3113412202462317094", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "From drastically changing our spending pattern to overthrowing governments, Social Media has deeply entrenched our lives & mind. I often reflect on how Social Media has changed the perception of Yoga. Mentioning here a few points. I am not against Social Media but discerning Yoga practitioners should surely reflect \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc\n\n1) Traditional Yogic knowledge is based in definite principles & practices. Core message of Gita/Sutra has not changed for hundreds of years.The scriptures teach clearly & in context. But, Social Media is a subjective platform. A Yoga Influencer who experiences things in a particular way may end up summarizing personal (subjective) experience as the Truth of Yoga, stating \"For me Yoga is XYZ, therefore Yoga is XYZ\". This perpetuates subjectivism, especially if there is no teacher to mediate or ability to discern\n\n2)\u00a0Instead of reflecting on \u201cWhat is it that I need from Yoga\u201d, we end up asking \u201cWhat are others doing that I should too\u201d. Constant comparison on Social Media could create FOMO & force us to comply with trends. Algorithm too encourages Herd Mentality.\nEg: Forcing oneself to do a Yoga Challenge to stay relevant, or be seen\n\n3) This is the reason why, every time there is a new Socio-Political Issue, newer definitions of Yoga are born on Social Media\n \u00a0\u00a0\n4) Popularity is perceived as experience & wisdom. A blue-tick neither automatically makes someone venerable, nor wise. A simpleton Yogi may not realize this & fall into a Bandwagon trap\n\n5) As a Visual Medium, Social Media keeps us engaged in the sensory world. But Yoga is about moving away, or at least regulating senses\n\n6) We are made to alter our perception & behavior based on Algorithms. Insta moved from Image to Video format making movement modality videos garner more views v/s still pics, reinforcing a belief that movement modality is Yoga\n\n7) Algorithm has power to selectively promote specific ideas & censor others, creating lopsided view of Yoga. Unaware users unconsciously buy into it. Through images & videos we are told how to think & what to do, thus erasing our ability to think critically. Critical thinking is Buddhi, the most important faculty for a Yogin\n\nPls Share \ud83d\ude4f", "total_engagement": 1136, "engagement_rate": 0.03120793384797121, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-29T13:41:18.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "points", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "context", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "perception & behavior", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "experience & wisdom", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "governments", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ideas & censor", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga influencer", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga practitioners", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reason", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lives", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mind", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "unaware", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fomo &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "principles & practices", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "knowledge", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Beauty & Fitness", "confidence": 0.9621579647064209}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328839232, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:44.068Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:44.068Z"}, {"id": 607775132328839231, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "549035460", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:44.062Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:44.062Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510779, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:27.077Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.464Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510780, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:27.083Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.470Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175211884388, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs3gaJoICGs/", "post_id": "3114100201881608620", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": "Naarden-Bussum", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "Dear Europe, after 4 long years of waiting, I am finally here. So, looking forward to seeing, hugging, dancing, laughing, crying & learning together again. Honestly, what motivated me to leave the comforts of my home & to go through the gruelling 3 month long Visa process is solely the love of my people here. Last four years were not easy for me at all, just like for many, & that time has deeply impacted my teachings & the ways in which I want to teach henceforth\n\nFeeling sentimental as I realize that this year I enter the 3rd decade of teaching internationally. Funny, how years slip away in a jiffy\n\n19 years ago, in 2004, I had a tough choice to make - to empty my savings & buy a posh new car that was launched in India then, or travel to Europe to share what I truly believed in\n\nSo, I emptied my modest savings & set off to Europe for 3 months with no plan, a little dream, a faint sense of purpose, a lot of uncertainty, a huge self-doubt & with only 92 Euros in pocket, because thats all I had left with me by then\n\nI want to take this opportunity to Thank all those who have let me in their homes, have done their best to organize workshops, fed me, showed me around, & took care of me, especially in the initial years, the 2004 - 2007 period. You know who you are & I deeply Thank You for your support \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n\nGrateful for all the bitter sweet experiences that came my way - the joys, the misadventures, the planning, the logistics, the seminars, the retreats, the success, the stomp-outs, the workshop no-shows, the popularity, the cancellations, the racial profiling, the bullying, the flight delays, the violent attacks in public transports, the thefts, the hospital ER runs, the sleepless nights at the airports, the sangha, the songs, the tears, the charity, the economic losses, the glorious teacher trainings, & above all, meeting inspirational students & lifelong friends that are like a family now\n\nI have tried to integrate all these experiences (bhoga) sincerely in my life & grow through them.They have helped me excavate myself & I am happier as I become hollow \n\nFriends, I have missed you all, & am looking forward to see what unfolds in the next 3 weeks. See you soon \u2764\ufe0f", "total_engagement": 853, "engagement_rate": 0.0234334221587319, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-30T12:28:14.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "&", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "savings &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "europe", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "workshops", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "dancing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "visa", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teachings", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "car", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& learning", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "crying", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "friends", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "home", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "savings &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ways", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "students &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "experiences", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "many", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bhoga", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "selfdoubt &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "process", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teacher trainings & above", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328839239, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:44.293Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:44.293Z"}, {"id": 607775132328839236, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "963549824", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:44.276Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:44.276Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510781, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:27.110Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.491Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510782, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:27.122Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.503Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175211884387, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs8sEXPoaYd/", "post_id": "3115558856116250141", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "Found a beautiful old picture of my dear teacher\u00a0& thought of writing about Fear & Time - a topic not much discussed in popular Yoga\n\nDuring my study with him in a N\u0101tha Monastery in Nepal we would talk a lot about dates & years in history of Yogic traditions\n\nNow, in Nepal they use Vikram Samvat calendar by which we are in the year 2080. But, in India, we use Shaka Samvat system by which we are in 1945. So, whenever he used to talk history I had to keep 3 different calendars in mind. There was no single time frame for me to refer\n\nI also remember, back in 2006, I was about to miss a flight in Europe because I did not account for Daylight time-saving. I had no idea people tampered with time like this because we do not have that system in India\n\nFriends, all our fears are linked to death, & death is linked to time. But Time is psychologically real, not absolutely real. If time is a psychological phenomenon, why do we get so bound by it? That\u2019s because of our attachments \n\nEinstein states in Special Theory of Relativity that time is relative. Even Yoga regards time to be relative. Yet we keep fighting time in our head. How tightly are we bound to temporal constructs like getting a job by this age, marrying & having kids by this age, biological clock, not aging & so on\n\nTime & Death is an important topic in traditional Yoga. Upanishads mention death & its nature repeatedly. So close is the relation that in Yoga, Time & Death are indicated by the same word, Kaal. Both are psychological (mental) realities & not absolute realities. Therefore, when a Yogin moves beyond mind, the Yogin also moves beyond time\n\nMany of us are exhausted chasing time & ruled by the fear it brings. That\u2019s because we see time as something absolute & not as a passing mental phenomenon. This is where Yoga comes in. Yoga helps us manage our mind, & hence regulate the time\n\nThis is also why advanced Hatha Yoga practices are done in Cemeteries. Here I remember a profound quote from one of my favorite western philosophers, Martin Heidegger. In a lecture in 1961, Heidegger was asked what should we do to live better lives, to which he said: \u201cwe should simply aim to spend more time in graveyards\u201d", "total_engagement": 512, "engagement_rate": 0.014065547649789841, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-01T12:46:19.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "nepal", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "n\u0101tha monastery", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fear & time", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "age marrying", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "death & death", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "topic", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "system", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "death & its nature", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ontime & death", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lot", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga time & death", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mental realities &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thought", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& not", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "absolute", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "picture", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "india", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "aging", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "dates", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "calendar", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mind", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teacher", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "time", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "history", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "study", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328839300, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:44.618Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:44.618Z"}, {"id": 607775132328839299, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1841301906", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:44.606Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:44.606Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510783, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:27.173Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.537Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510784, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:27.181Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.545Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175217234204, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs_RaU-owPQ/", "post_id": "3116286043186463696", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": ".\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd What really is Bhakti Yoga?\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffd Is it only about praying to some deity, chanting mantras & singing kirtan songs?\n\nHere's a summary,\n\nHuman existence is driven by 2 main impulses, existential anxiety (fear) & \nthe need to belong to something greater (faith)\n\nIn my teachings I repeatedly clarify that Yogic life is nothing but a journey from fear to faith\n\nFaith is a journey & not a one-time happening. Faith gradually matures till it becomes total \u2013 choiceless. All ancient traditions indicate this through stories of sacrifice. In choiceless faith everything happens on its own accord, with a profound sense of calm & effortlessness - this is Ishwarapranidh\u0101na\n\nThe journey of faith is not easy. Faith is tested, again & again, & that is what makes faith grow. The evolution of faith is Bhakti Yoga\n\nBhakti is not all prayer & chanting, it\u2019s about navigating life\u2019s challenges with firm faith in something greater than the limited self (ego)\n\nLiving in faith is essential to humanness, & trying to live in faith is Bhakti Yoga.\n\nFaith is not all about religion. Atheists may not have faith in 'God' but have faith in the power of science. No matter who or what one has faith in, it is essential for human thriving. If you dont like the word 'faith', use trust\n\nYoga practitioners can grow their faith in three things, the teacher-teaching, 'God', & self.\n\nWhatever is easily accessible, one can start with that\n\nThis faith is not blind faith. The path of faith itself tests the practitioner's faculty of reason, compassion, & presence of mind. Faith (shraddh\u0101) in Bhakti Yoga is not at the cost of suspending critical thinking. The journey of faith is like any relationship \u2013 it takes time to mature & has its own ups & downs. So, be patient. Whatever or whoever you choose to have faith in, give that faith time to mature. How you win your daily battles determines the maturity of your faith\n\nPersonally, I see my entire life as a journey of faith & nothing else.This is my process, my practice, my path & my teaching\n\nAllow your faith to raise you from your fear.\n\n#yogabeyondposes #bhaktiyoga", "total_engagement": 908, "engagement_rate": 0.02494436966017417, "network_type": "instagram",

And ofcourse it was great to meet new seekers \n\nOver last 10 years I've consistantly expressed the importance of simplifying Yogic teachings & focusing more on the process than the pose, more on the trust & not just the techniques. Through this tour I am trying to reinforce the above even more emphatically. The strain of life & stress of survival has become heavier now, people are physically more exhausted & mentally more spent. In such a case, where life itself has become complex, the spiritual teachings dont need to be complicated\n\nI conducted 5 gatherings in the last 7 days & met hundreds of people, from 17 year olds to 70 year olds, from cancer patients, lawyers, home makers, medical doctors and to Yoga teachers, all agreed that in times like these we need simplified Yogic teachings that stick to the core tenets of Yoga. Yoga that is not diluted but accessible to one and all\n\nFunnily enough, one would not even call these workshops \"Yoga workshop\" in the conventional sense, yet they were closest to the core tenets of Yogic tradition\n\nWe met, we sang, we talked, we discussed, we cried, we shared, we empathized with each others challenges, we laughed, we respired together, we hugged & somewhere deep within we tapped into the essence of our Being -

In fact, it would go against Patanjali\u2019s core tenets to say that the goal of his Yoga system is Oneness.\n\nPatanjali\u2019s Ashtanga Yoga culminates in Only-ness and not One-ness. It is called Kaivalya, a term that is derived from the word Kevala, which means Only (or, by itself).\n\nPatanjali\u2019s Yoga is mainly based in Sankhya philosophy, which is fundamentally Dualistic. Dualism is a philosophical orientation where everything is finally reduced to two independent and fundamentally different principles. For Patanjali, the two principles are Purusha & Prakriti i.e consciousness and matter. \n\nDualistic philosophies are different to \u2018One-ness\u2019 propagating Monistic philosophies like Advaita Vedanta, where everything is reduced to a single reality.\n\nThe philosophical duel between Dualism and Monism has been going on in the history of global thought for thousands of years, may it be Parmenides vs Heraclitus of ancient Greece, Spinoza vs Descartes of medieval Europe, or Sankhya-Yoga vs Advaita Vedanta of Indic thought.\n\nSuperfically, such differentiations may not account to much but, as sincere Yoga students & teachers, it becomes important to have a basic idea of the key philosophical differences between the many Indic spiritual philosophies so as to avoid projecting one's own ideas on the author's original intention", "total_engagement": 1040, "engagement_rate": 0.028570643663635615, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-08T21:08:33.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "goal", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga students & teachers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "purusha & prakriti", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "process", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "case", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "spirituality", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Beauty & Fitness", "confidence": 0.9621767401695251}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328839423, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:45.706Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:45.706Z"}, {"id": 607775132328839422, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "2107562172", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:45.698Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:45.698Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510791, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:27.372Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.686Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510792, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:27.378Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.692Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175217234195, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CtSMfBNIWLA/", "post_id": "3121612399877120704", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "True renunciation that Yoga talks about is not in giving up the world, but in giving up the idea that the world is the answer to our questions.\n.\nDon't run away, \ndon't hide, \ndont ignore, \ndon't avoid.\n.\nLive in the world, do what you have to, and Face challenges with Trust and Patience.

They help us breathe more, feel good, & 'opened up'. The term \u201cHeart Opener\u201d has a fairly wide scope that includes aspects like openness, compassion, empathy, love, & togetherness. It is popular to say that back-bends \u201copen the heart\u201d or they are 'Heart Openers'. But, how do Yoga scriptures indicate this process of Heart Opening?\n\nTraditionally, \u2018Heart Opener\u2019, as a metaphorical term, stems from the idea that there is something closed in the Heart area (hriday\u0101kasha)  that needs to be opened. That \u2018closed\u2019 part is known as \u2018Granthi\u2019 or a knot.\n\nThe Mandukya Upanishad\u00a0 2-2-8 talks about this knot & says,\n\nbhidyate hridaya granthih chhidyante sarva sanshayah, kshiyante chasya karmaNi tasmin drishte paravare\n\nWhich means, \"pierced is the knot of the heart, slashed are all the doubts. Annihilated are the chains of Karma, when the Truth is realised\".\n\nThis knot is the knot of ignorance of our Self. It\u2019s the knot of attachment to the idea we have created about our self, a perception on which we base our existence. An idea of self  that bases itself on shaky beliefs and feeds on temporary satisfactions keeps sapping our energy and holds us in anxiety.\n\nAs the above line says, it\u2019s the knot of self-doubt. This doubt is no ordinary doubt, it\u2019s the doubt emerging from fundamental ignorance of Being. The doubt emerging from not knowing the Self. It\u2019s the knot that binds us to the cycle of suffering for lifetimes.\n\nBreaking free from this knot begins only when one becomes ruthlessly honest about one\u2019s spiritual journey, is ready to detach from all that doesn\u2019t serve the journey of self-discovery, & becomes strongly dedicated to Sadhana. This needs a lot of Trust. Unless the Yogic seeker is ready for this \u2018leap of faith\u2019, no amount of back-bends will help open the Heart.\n\nPic: carving from the stone gates of a 600 year old temple taken by

coming home to family. Over the last 10 years we have built a loving and supportive community of student seekers that have grown in self-understanding through the methods of Yoga. We have done Teacher Trainings here, we have had numerous retreats, workshops, classes, we have done cultural-spiritual travels in Lithuania and across India, and everytime we meet our hearts open up a little more, making us calmer, simpler and happier.\n\nThis time too, we met, we practiced, we studied, we danced, we meditated, we sang and flowered our hearts to the unconditional Love of existence.\n\nMy visit here started with a Satsang evening of chanting and celebration, and concluded with a 3 day \"Coming back to the Self\" retreat that was based on teachings of the Upanishads. Now, these students will go and share the understanding with their families, students and loved ones keeping the sweet stream of transformation alive across generations.\n\nAll this wouldn't have been possible without the single minded love and trust of my dear student @ramune_dhara, her loving husband, her daughter, and all my dear friends and students who regroup and recaliberate everytime we meet with the same Energy, Love and Dedication.

If someone compliments you, accept it with grace and joy. In the words of Bhagavad Gita, your core abilities are your Svabh\u0101va, your personal nature. Work with it.

Though we didn\u2019t speak English at home, this word stuck with me for some reason. As a kid, I used to love hanging out with my mom in the kitchen, especially when she would marinate fish & veggies. When asked, she would say in English that she was \u2018marinating\u2019 instead of using a word from my mother tongue, Marathi\n\nI was fascinated by the entire process of marination, how things felt & looked different after the period of transformation. It was like magic for the kid in me\n\nAs I grew up & started teaching Yoga, I saw myself using the same word to explain the process of Yogic learning\n\nYogic education is not as immediate as learning Math, 2+2=4, & that\u2019s it. Rather, it is literally a process of marination, where the student marinates over years in knowledge through study, practice, & living\n\nI think as Yoga Teachers it's important to realize this, especially in recent times when Yoga is seen as instant gratification & being a Yoga Teacher is a numbers (hours) game\n\nDear Yoga Teachers, Yoga teaching is NOT about passing on knowledge that you have learned, but transferring wisdom from what you have experienced. Our modern competitive Yoga teaching scene compels us to want to teach as soon as we learn something new, out of FOMO or out of a need for validation that Social Media ignites. There\u2019s a certain hurry to establish oneself as an 'advanced teacher\u2019. Be mindful of this impulse, of your impatience\n\nGive your learning the time to resonate within. Allow your study to marinate in every cell of your body. Live what you have studied, experience what you have heard, & realize what you have been taught.

The next day she said, \u201cI saw your Instagram handle. Your Yoga seems more like a life-coaching thing than Yoga. I didn\u2019t see any pictures of you in poses\u201d. Saying this, she walked away\n\nI have to give it to her. Yes, the Yoga I teach does come across as life-coaching, thats because Yoga, in its traditional sense, is a life-skill, & teaching Yoga is life-skill coaching\u00a0\n\nKrishna was Arjuna\u2019s \u2018life-coach\u2019 who showed him a way out of personal delusion. The Upanishadic Gurus were life-coaches to young Brahmacharis who came to the ashram at age 8 to stay for 12 years. Buddha was the \u2018life-coach\u2019 of King Bimbisara, & so was Ramakrishna the coach-mentor of Swami Vivekananda \u2013 all this because Yoga is a science of self, & the self never operates in isolation from life\n\nThe modalities of Yoga, from asana to dhyana & the philosophies of Yoga, from Vedanta to Tantra, are directed towards refining the mind to help an individual navigate life\n\nKrishna in Gita, Buddha in his ashtanga path, Swatmarama in Hatha Pradpika, & the Upanishadic Rishis talk about diet, habit patterns, & lifestyle \u2013 because, Yoga is all about living efficiently & purposefully. And, since no one is an island, the ethical injunctions of Yama-Niyama are directed towards upliftment of the Society (lokasangraha) & not merely an individual\n\nThus, Yoga has always been about the self & life. And Yoga is a life-skill\n\nI am very clear about the kind of Yoga I want to teach, & actually teach. Even in my current Europe tour I am emphasizing the holsitic nature of Yoga, as a life-skill, beyond poses. This clarity has come with its own fair share of damages, like walkouts, cancellations, hate-mails, being labelled inauthentic, & most definitely, financial compromise over the years. But, at the end of the day, I am happy to help a few navigate the rough terrains of life with a lighter mind through holistic teachings of Yoga. In that sense - Yes, my Yoga is surely life (skill) coaching\n\nPlease Share \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n\n#yogabeyondposes", "total_engagement": 3167, "engagement_rate": 0.08700310431032114, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-17T08:35:09.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "diet", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "someone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "workshop", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "instagram", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& actually teach", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "efficiently", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "habit patterns & lifestyle", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "self & life", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "insta", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "dhyana & the philosophies of", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hatha pradpika & the upanishadic rishis", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "brahmacharis", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bimbisara &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "pictures", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ramakrishna", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "krishna", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "yogabeyondposes"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Beauty & Fitness", "confidence": 0.9632585048675537}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132328839589, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:47.669Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:47.669Z"}, {"id": 607775132328839586, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1701498388", "created_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:47.649Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-25T21:36:47.649Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510805, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:27.565Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.944Z"}, {"id": 607775132326510806, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T03:35:27.569Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:07.955Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175219397555, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Ctqh8hUoNcA/", "post_id": "3128462185645266688", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": "Munich, Germany", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "The 3rd leg of my Europe trip is over.

It reminds me of the Yogic concept of Yajna that Yoga practitioners should know \n\nYogins have always believed in fundamental interconnectedness between everything, understood as Yajna. Bhagavad Gita asks us to be conscious of this interconnectedness so that every action not only contributes to self-growth but also to the greater good of all. Like a watch made of hundreds of small parts, each part being an important aspect of the bigger whole, we too need to work out of a realization of our importance in the smooth functioning of the world\n\nThe term \u2018Yajna\u2019 literally means an act of offering. It can be viewed at personal & social levels. Most times Yajna is translated as \u2018sacrifice\u2019 - but it is anything but that\n\nYajna has been mentioned in the oldest Veda, Rig Veda. Hindus perform Yajna by offering items like ghee, milk, grains, into holy fire, which is symbolic of the host\u2019s contribution to grand interconnectedness of everything. Its an act by which the host surrenders to Gods, only to serve the larger salvation of humanity, shrey\u0101rtha (Ref: Apastamba Yajna Paribhasa-sutra 1.1)\n\nThe host\u2019s input keeps the wheel of interconnectedness turning. When everyone sincerely contributes, the system becomes beneficial to all without any resource wastage. This model is nowadays called \u2018Circular Economics\u2019 in modern macroeconomic theory. If everyone were to behave as they please, without responsibility, wasting resources, without a care for social harmony, our society would be chaotic\n\nWorking with this harmony in mind is called Karma Yoga. Please know, Karma Yoga is neither free labor, nor charity, as is popularly understood these days. Gita asks us to be aware of the inherent interconnectedness of all & contribute towards universal balance. This is the fundamental moral virtue that a Yogin lives by. This is also why Krishna asks Arjuna to do his appointed duty of fighting & defending his kingdom instead of running away to become a  monk\n\nThe process of Yoga is itself a Yajna\n\nShare with

"media": [], "post_text": "To understand the deeper reason why Beeja Mantras were contemplated upon (not necessarily chanted) by Yogis, we have to appreciate how Indic knowledge systems converge Language & Creation into spiritual philosophy\n\nAccording to Sanskrit grammarians, the word (Shabda) is nothing but a string of letters & letters are sound vibrations. These sound vibrations have always existed & always will - that's why letters are called Akshara, the indestructible\n\nIn its indestructibility, every letter (as sound vibration) is Absolute. This is why, letters are equated to the Absolute (Brahman) & are called Shabda Brahma \u2013 the Absolute Sound\n\nOm is the single syllable/word through which Absolute is denoted as sound. Vibrations will always be around, even if we are not. As Brahadaranyaka Upanishad says, \u2018Vak Vai Brahma\u2019 - speech is verily Brahman\n\nIndic philosophies have contemplated on the link between word & world over last 2000 years, unlike modern Western philosophers who focused their attention on language just 100 odd years ago \u2013 famously called the \u2018Linguistic Turn of Philosophy\u2019. Many western philosophers like Russel thought language to be inadequate for expression due to its vague & ambiguous nature\n\nSo, since the word-sound creates the world, it also creates individual human. Humans are embodied sound, if you will. Tantras say that all letters of Sanskrit alphabet are plotted within human body, to form, what I call, a \u2018Sound Matrix\u2019. The Yogin manipulates this Sound Matrix through Beeja Dhyana (meditation), & Mantra Japa (mostly mental). This is why pronunciation is crucial in mantra chanting, as one small mispronunciation could change the word-sound\n\nEach Beeja holds the energy of each element & functions as a vortex between cosmic & individual consciousness. In Tantras, letters are also worshipped as Goddesses \n\nA right Beeja Sadhana first brings \u2018Individual Sound Matrix\u2019 in harmony with \u2018Universal Sound Matrix\u2019 at each elemental level (5 Chakras) & this harmony is absorbed into the \u2018Mind Matrix\u2019- 6th Chakra. This itself is full Kundalini arousal\n\nThis is how, the Yogin uses word that created the world, for dissolution (Laya) of the ego-self \u2013 This is Laya Yoga", "total_engagement": 1130,

"post_text": "We practice Shavasana at the end of an asana class to allow the body to recover, or to relax.Though the system of using Shavasana as \"final relaxation\" to end the Yoga class is new, its benefits are well-recognized\n\nThese benefits have also been mentioned in Hatha Yogic scriptures like Hatha Pradipika & Gheranda Samhita. But, as with everything in Yoga, it is just one part of the story\n\nShavasana was used to relax the body & mind in pre-modern Yoga too, but the end goal was not only about resting the body after an asana practice \n\nShavasana was also used as a Dharana, as a mindfulness practice \n\nScriptures like the 17th century Hatha Tattva Kaumudi (7:11) asks practitioners to contemplate on Shiva with gaze fixed on the tip of the nose in Shavasana (n\u0101s\u0101gra \u0101dh\u0101ya dr\u1e63am smaran Shivam...)\n\nThe great scholar philosopher & mystic Yogi,  R. D. Ranade (1886-1957) used to use Shavasana for the above benefits when he suffered due to ill-health for years & couldn't sit\n\nThe idea is to use Shavasana to relax the mind so deeply that it helps in deeper spiritual contemplations \n\nThe term Shavasana means the posture of a corpse. In Gheranda Samhita, it is called Mritasana, posture of a dead body\n\nWhy was an asana thats supposed to connote rest & relaxation named after something triggering like death or corpse? \n\nMany other words could have been used to indicate \u201crest & relaxation\u201d. Yet, they chose to use words like \u2018Shava\u2019 & \u2018Mrita\u2019 \u2013 Corpse or Dead, Why? \n\nThis is because Shavasana was a part of a larger gamut of practices called Laya Yoga \u2013 the Yoga of dissolution of the ego-self. Laya Yoga is a mature stage of Hatha path where the corporeal body is consciously & cognitively \u201cdissolved\u201d\n\nThe reason for practicing Shavasana was to consciously reduce \u201cDeha Bh\u0101va\u201d \u2013 the sense of \u201cI am the body\u201d or, identification with one's physicality. Complete removal of Dehabh\u0101va was/is the foundation of Hatha & Laya Yoga\n\nThe locus of Premodern Hatha Yoga was not in the physical body, like it is in popular postural Yoga. The corporeal body was seen just as a means to an end, Moksha & not as a goal in itself\n\nThis crucial point needs to be borne in mind by contemporary Yoga practitioners", "total_engagement": 2231, "engagement_rate": 0.061289525013049094, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-09-27T12:29:10.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "shava", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "body & mind", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "benefits", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "body", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "scholar", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "philosopher & mystic yogi", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "years", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "system", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rest & relaxation", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& gheranda samhita", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hatha pradipika", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "relaxation", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "part", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Beauty & Fitness", "confidence": 0.959209144115448}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132331210992, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-29T22:01:42.771Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-29T22:01:42.771Z"}, {"id": 607775132331210991, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "213323149", "created_at": "2023-09-29T22:01:42.765Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-29T22:01:42.765Z"}, {"id": 607775132333351667, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:08.413Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-17T03:42:52.936Z"}, {"id": 607775132333351668, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-10-02T08:25:08.430Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-17T03:42:52.942Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175291834445, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CxuCJrUoU_s/", "post_id": "3201505846192328684", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/27dae8f7bc7fbcf74d220a45bae40c7f.JPEG", "phash": "bacc45223f9e3aa1", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beard", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8738276958465576}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8010277152061462}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7961832284927368}, {"entity": "facial hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7258321046829224}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6287310719490051}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.43651852011680603}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4323086440563202}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3983977138996124}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5303216576576233}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4565524458885193}, {"entity": "baseball cap", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.36537522077560425}, {"entity": "soccer ball", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23359432816505432}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-05T00:42:38.199Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-05T06:39:26.144Z"}}], "post_text": "Start off your day with positivity.\nHere's a bare minimum Yoga practice for those who are just starting off, or are too pressed for time.

Even today I believe that we live in times of spiritual excess, & that there is a need to simplify Yogic spirituality without diluting its essence\n\nYou see, the Yoga path has its own innate intelligence. When one works sincerely under a teacher\u2019s guidance over time, the path organically flowers in such a way that one ends up with just one or two modalities that nourish sustained growth. This happens because the sadhana gradually simplifies the mind, & a simple mind doesn\u2019t hanker for more\n\nBut, spiritual consumerism could distract us from this realization by creating a sense of spiritual \"FOMO\", pushing us to incessantly engage in multiple practices simultaneously, potentially leading to confusion, overwhelm, or a feeling of not being good enough. This is already a big issue with many Yoga teachers\n\nUnless one deeply recognizes the natural spiritual drive towards simplification, one will be swallowed by spiritual consumerism that fosters a need for accumulation, where seekers crave for spiritual products, experiences, & teachings, adding complexity to their journey. The frenzy to mould one\u2019s sadhana according to the latest spiritual trends or out of fear of being \u2018left behind\u2019, can distract one from the naturally unfolding simplicity of an inner-focused practice, as seekers become preoccupied with what everyone is doing, instead of asking what is it that they need\n\nPatanjali talks about \u2018Ekatattva Abhyasa\u2019, practice of single principle (PYS 1:32). Maharishi Vyasa calls it generating \u2018Ekagra Chitta', one pointed mind. The Bhakti Yogis call it \u2018Eka Nishtha Bhakti\u2019, singleness of faith.

Your ability to let go of unnecessary spiritual clutter & distraction enhances your Yoga\n\nIf you feel overwhelmed, I have a simple suggestion to start with.

Muscle loss due to ageing is called Sarcopenia. Between the age of 40-60, a person on average gains about 1 pound of fat per year & loses 1/2 pound of muscle. By age 75, 50% of muscle mass is lost, Source: The Merck Manual of Geriatrics\n\nTherefore, its our duty toward our body to work on retaining muscle mass. Retaining muscle mass has many benefits & is crucial as we age. Lean muscle helps in fighting diabetes & obesity, helps maintain structural integrity, improves immunity, keeps metabolism high & helps avoid risk of fall & fractures. Strength training helps retain muscle mass. Muscle corresponds to Prithvi Tattva (Earth element), & we all need it for body-mind stability, esp. V\u0101ta dominant individuals\n\nStudy of 57 adults aged 65\u201394 showed that performing resistance exercises 3 times per week increased muscle strength over 12 weeks, (Tufts University study)\n\n Here are some tips to reclaim muscle tissue,\n\n1) Be active, move every day for at least 60 mins\n2) Strength train 3-4 times a week \u2013 focus on compound movements\n3) Work on each body part twice a week for optimal muscle growth. Train using Progressive Overload Technique i.e gradually increase resistance \n4) Get atleast 7-8 hours of sleep for optimal recovery \n5) Stay hydrated & get-in those Macros, including proteins. Dehydration can reduce insulin sensitivity which impairs muscle growth (Judelson et. al 2008)\n6) Practice Pranayama, esp. Deep Slow Breathing, & Meditate every day (Had to get that in \ud83d\ude09 )\n7) Reduce stress. Mental stress can restrict optimal muscle growth\n8 ) Stop starving your body & experimenting with fad diets. Sacrificing muscle mass with fad diet is literally self-destruction\n9) Work with a trainer till you get a hang of how to train yourself, safely\n10) Change your mindset about muscle & strength training. If you are a human & have muscle, you need strength training\n.\nIn above pic. adipose tissue means fat tissue.

Back in 2008, I was staying for a few days in Joshi Muth studying Vedanta. Joshi Muth is one of the most important monasteries in India - established by Adi Shankaracharya, the proponent of Advaita Vedanta philosophy, in 9th Century\n\nAs I sat quietly leaning against the wall, a sparrow flew in through the window, pecked at a few rice grains from the altar & flew away happily. When she left, a small mouse came in, ate a few grains & ran to the corner. When the mouse went away, the sparrow, who patiently waited for her turn, would fly in for her share. When the mouse would see her gone, he would run in and bite on a few grains. This went on for a while. A moment came when they both stopped their visits. I guess they were content with what they had received. The temple premise was quiet again, after a good 20 mins of loud squeaking & chirping\n\nAt that very moment, as if synchronized, the Swami sitting on the other end of the temple & I started laughing loudly. He looked at me, I looked at him. Raising his eyebrows in amazement he said, \u2018Ishwar Kripa\u2019, meaning, God\u2019s blessing. I, in total bewilderment, said \u2018Sama Drishti\u2019, meaning, equal vision\n\nAfter a pregnant pause, we both started giggling again like two small boys\n\nNeither the Swami, nor I, felt the need to shoo the creatures away from the Sanctum\n\nThe creature visits & their partaking of grains was neither destroying the sanctity of the altar nor our silence. After all, they too had an equal right on God\u2019s bounty, so who were we to disturb their routine?\n\nThis unspoken understanding between the Swami & I could be summarized as the basis of Vedanta philosophy - divine grace & equal vision\n\nAfter that incident I humbly approached him.

context of teaching a class ?\" \n\nHere is what my reply was,\n\nI believe that the expertise in teaching a Yoga class lies in how the teachers seamlessly balance giving general instructions while supervising with specific attention\n\nEffective Yoga teaching balances generic guidance with individualized, specific attention, ensuring every student feels seen and supported in their practice.\n\nGeneral instructions establish the rhythm and flow of the class, ensuring everyone is on the same page regarding the sequence and overall practice goals.\n\nGeneral instructions also promote inclusivity, making the practice accessible to students of various levels, backgrounds, and experiences, fostering a sense of belonging and unity within the class.\n\nSpecific attention ensures students with varying abilities and limitations receive personalized guidance, enhancing their practice tailored to their body's requirements.\n\nPersonalized supervision prevents injuries by correcting improper postures and aligning movements, ensuring students perform asanas correctly and safely.\n\nWhat more would you add to this, apart from developing soft skills like empathy etc.

"post_text": "Most of us know the Yama-Niyama mentioned in the Yoga Sutra, which is great. But, did you know that most Yoga scriptures mention their own Yama-Niyama ?\n\nOne then wonders, why is it that Yama-Niyama becomes central to Yoga based spirituality?\n\nIndian spiritual tradition is not devoid of ethical considerations. Yoga aims for self-realization, & the ethical-moral principles (Yama-Niyama) form the foundation of Yoga philosophy, guiding practitioners toward self-realization, mental well-being, selfless action, social harmony, healthy relationships, & cosmic-environmental consciousness. These ethical principles guide the seekers in fostering inner peace (Shanti), contentment (Santosha) & harmony (Samatva), which are essential for spiritual progress. By adhering to these principles, individuals create a conducive environment for their spiritual journey while positively impacting the world around them\n\nBhagavad Gita gives a list of 32 traits to work upon. In fact, some of them are similar to Patanjali\u2019s Yama-Niyama, like ahinsa \u2013 non-injury, satya \u2013 truth, santosha \u2013 contentment, & other more accessible conducts like akrodha \u2013 absence of anger, shanti \u2013 peacefulness (peaceful nature), daya \u2013 compassion, mardava - gentleness, abhaya \u2013 fearlessness, & so on. Even Mahabharata talks about Yama-Niyama in context of personal & social behaviour\n\nHatha Pradipika too mentions 10 Yamas & 10 Niyamas, some of my favorite are, Kshama \u2013 forgiveness, Dhrti \u2013 fortitude, Aarjava \u2013 non-hypocrisy, sincerity, Mitahaara \u2013 measured diet, Mati \u2013 reflection & Japa \u2013 recitation of mantra\n\nOne point to note here is that, in the traditional sense of Yoga, there can be no Yoga without ethical-moral conduct (Yama-Niyama). The Yogic process starts with first sorting out one\u2019s external & internal relationships, without which spiritual pursuit becomes a mere show, hypocracy, as Bhagavad Gita states\n\nSo, when in doubt, get back to the basics of Yama & Niyama\n\nShare with friends \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n\n#yamaniyama #yogaphilosophy #yogateacher", "total_engagement": 778, "engagement_rate":

This post is dedicated to the mental health of Yoga professionals (& others too). If we want to serve others, we need to take care of ourselves too. \n\nOfcourse the list could be more, but for now these 3 points are good enough for those who want to sincerely work upon their mental health. Please share this post with your friends & those who may need it\n\n3 things to avoid on Social Media as a Yoga practitioner for the sake of your Mental health\n\n1) Do not compare yourself with others\n\nSocial media is about presentation. Everyone tries to present their best, & that's fine. But someone else's best may not necessarily be your best. Each one of us is unique, and as a Yoga practitioner, one must focus inward and discover that uniqueness and grow through it rather than trying to be like someone else. In fact, this is one of the most important lessons of Karma Yoga in the Bhagavad Gita\n\n \n2) Do not blindly believe everything you see or read\n\nJust because something is available on social media doesn't mean it is sacrosanct, especially when it comes to scriptural & scientific claims about Yoga. Surely, there is great content out there, but do not sacrifice your ability to think critically just because someone is popular or something is trending. Do your own research & draw your own conclusion\n\n \n3) Do not allow trends to distract you from your focus\n\nWhen you do not have clarity in what you stand for as a Yoga professional, anything & everything has the power to distract you. Every new style, topic, hashtag & trend will light up your FOMO & make you rush here and there to be that. As Patanjali says, \u2018vritti sarupyam itaratra\u2019. This is exactly how spiritual materialism works.

talks called \"Silent Saints - the women yogis of India\" that I've been conducting across the world since 2015\n\nSo, here goes...\n\nDay 1 - Lalla / Lalleshwari / Lal Dedh\n\nShe is the Yogini prophetess of Kashmir, whose date has been approximately fixed at the end of the fourteenth century. She was a mendicant ascetic, who wandered about preaching the yogic doctrines as the best means of ultimate absorption into the Supreme\n\nShe has been rightly described as 'a predecessor' of the Medieval Social Reformers of India like R\u0101m\u0101nand, Kabir, & others of the 15th & later centuries. She was the creator of a style of mystic poetry called\u00a0vatsun\u00a0or\u00a0Vakhs, which in Sanskrit means \"speech\"\n\nWhat I love about Lalla's teachings is that they are practical, yet deeply rooted in detachment (vairagya). She speaks mostly in parabels, which I love. Lalla, for me a mystical mystery to solve through my own unbecoming\n\nThe true saint, according to her, is ''the one who serves of all humankind through humility & loving kindness\"\n\nShe did not believe in the efficacy of external observances, ritualism, or idol worship. She insisted on the performance of duty for duty's sake, loving surrender to the divine & reflection on one's current state\n\nHere are some of her poems that I love, \n\n1) \nI, Lalla, entered\nthe gate of the mind\u2019s garden and saw\nShiva united with Sakti.\nI was immersed in the lake of undying bliss. \nHere, in this lifetime,\nI\u2019ve been unchained from the wheel\nof birth and death.\nWhat can the world do to me?\u00a0 \n\n2)\nI have seen an educated man starve,\na leaf blown off\u00a0 by bitter wind.\nOnce I saw a thoughtless fool\nbeat his cook.\nLalla has been waiting for the \nallure of the world to fall away.\u00a0 \n\n3) \nI might scatter the southern clouds,\ndrain the sea, or cure someone\nhopelessly ill.\nBut to change the mind\nof a fool\nis beyond me.", "total_engagement": 1865, "engagement_rate": 0.051234856185269635, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-10-16T09:14:13.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "determination", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "talks", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yogis", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "india &", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lalla", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "humankind", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "15th &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "level", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "essays", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "divine & reflection", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "women", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "kabir & others", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "humility & loving", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hardwork &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "patriarchy &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132387923725, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-21T22:46:58.563Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-21T22:46:58.563Z"}, {"id": 607775132387923724, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1063905744", "created_at": "2023-10-21T22:46:58.550Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-21T22:46:58.550Z"}, {"id": 607775132388084475, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-22T03:30:45.631Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T03:31:06.922Z"}, {"id": 607775132388084477, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-10-22T03:30:45.656Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T03:31:06.950Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175308704751, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cyd5CQQoJrt/", "post_id": "3214976552561318637", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "Thank You Dubai, for the love, lightness & learning.

Andal means \u2018she who rules\u2019\n\nShe is best known for her passionate love & devotion to Lord Krishna, which she expresses through poetry. Her most famous work is the lyrical rhapsody \"Thiruppavai,\" a collection of 30 hymns which depict her as a young girl in love with Krishna. In them she implores other young girls to observe penance, wake up early, & worship Lord Vishnu to attain good husbands & eternal bliss. Andal's verses are not just expressions of devotion but also literary masterpieces that are so deeply entrenched in the cultural fabric of South India that they are recited everyday by devoted Vaishanava women even today\n\nHer other significant work is \"Nachiar Tirumozhi,\" where she describes her longing for Lord Krishna, portraying herself as a Gopi (cowherd girl) seeking union with Him. The tone of her poems communicates divine pleasure in the mere sight of her beloved divine, supreme delight in his proximity & in the ineffable union with him\n\nThese 14 poems cover a wide range of topics, from imaginings of a little girl building sand castles, to a woman frustrated in love, calling her lover bitterly for having led her on & betrayed her\n\nIn her poems she also comes across as a woman who has experienced the Bliss of Divine but is now separated by that Bliss & is in anguish of separation \u2013 thus, one can say, Andal was born to manifest a dimension of Bhakti called as \u2018Bridal Mysticism\u2019. Her expressions, though raw, physical & in the language of ordinary human love, are of a mystical, supra-sensory nature. Her eventual Samadhi Consciousness in form of divine union with her beloved Krishna is represented by silence & implied by full moon\n\nHere are parts from 2 of her poems\n\n1) \nBring me the cool nectar from the mouth of His flute\nSpread it upon my face, it will revive me\nBring me the dust from the footprints left by the insensitive Lord\nSmear it upon my body, that life may linger\n\n2)\nMy Lord of Shrirangam, rich and righteous, who owns this sea-swept earth and the sky\nHas made his possession now complete with bangle I wore on my hand !", "total_engagement": 511, "engagement_rate": 0.014038075877036345, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-10-17T09:42:20.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132387923729, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-21T22:46:59.044Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-21T22:46:59.044Z"}, {"id": 607775132387923728, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "186216224", "created_at": "2023-10-21T22:46:59.035Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-21T22:46:59.035Z"}, {"id": 607775132388084487, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-22T03:30:45.710Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T03:31:07.026Z"}, {"id": 607775132388084488, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-10-22T03:30:45.725Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T03:31:07.033Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175308704718, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CyiXpcSoXPx/", "post_id": "3216237086841598961", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": ".\nNavaratra Day 3 - Women Yogis of India number 3\n\nAkkamahadevi, 12th\u00a0CE saint, mystic, & poetess, was a trailblazer in the Bhakti movement of India.

Her poems express the tension between family life, as a human wife & her love for the supreme divine, in context of her unhappy marriage to Kaushika, the king of the region\n\nHer devotional compositions, called Vachanas, are imbued with profound spiritual insights & eloquently express her Bhakti. Rejecting conventional expectations, she wandered naked, considering herself wedded solely to her Lord (Shiva), transcending societal judgments & material attachments. She is said to have thrown away her clothing & cast off all sense of shame, flagrantly defying all notions of women\u2019s sexuality\n\nHer poetry reflects spiritual longing, the ephemeral nature of life, & the quest for divine union, inspiring generations with her radical spirituality & unwavering faith.

The life story of Muktabai is chiefly bound up with that of the great Hatha Yogi & Bhakta, Sant Jnanadev who was one of her brothers. Even though as siblings the children were ostracized by the society and treated badly by the people, and in spite of their parents committing \"suicide\", the four children stuck together with integrity and perseverance, and achieved Moksha\n\nShe speaks of the secrets of 'Maha Yoga' and how to live successfully in this world and yet rise above it to reach out to God\n\nShe was a great Siddha 'Yogini' of the Natha Siddha lineage, like her brothers\n\nHer abhangas (spiritual poems) are full of deeper meaning of life and give instructions on how to manage life and spirituality being grounded in the world itself\n\nThere are some amazing stories of her spiritual prowess and situational wit in the short life of this dear Saint. Muktabai wrote forty-one abhang (spiritual poems) throughout her life span. I have been fortunate enough to grow up on her poems since my childhood\n\nOne of my favorite abanga is about her own spiritual transformation and her experience of totality when the duality dissolved. She speaks in deeply mystical parables, a kind of lingusitic style often used by Hatha Yogis, even today\n\nShe says\n\n\"An ant has flown to the sky and has swallowed the Sun. A great wonder has taken place indeed. A woman who is infertile has given birth to a child. A scorpion has gone to the nether world. Shesha, The serpent king is worshiping its own legs.

It\u2019s like multiplying the scope 24 times.That is when we start living Yoga & not just doing Yoga (asana)\n\nIndeed, a diligent asana practice is important, & a gateway to Yoga for many. But limiting the entirety of Yoga practice just to asana practice could narrow the scope of practice and keep the practitioner in a loop of guilt & self-blame for having missed their practice hour. I've seen way too many practitioners give up on Yoga because they couldn't continue with asana\n\nLets expand the definition of our 'Practice' & let out some steam from the pressure we put on ourselves as a practitioner \n\nThere is lots more to Yoga Sadhana (practice) than Asana Sadhana (postural practice)\n\nLook at your Life process itself as a Yoga practice.

Cherry picking narratives will only give us a uni-dimensional view of this vast knowledge system\n.\nSo, what should a Yoga student do to understand Yoga philosophy?\n.\nCommit to a long term study of Yoga philosophy from someone who has faith & experience in living the Yoga philosophy that they teach. Study with a teacher who not only makes you intellectually study but also helps you practically LIVE the philosophy to realize the teachings\n.\nRemember, the aim of Yoga philosophy is NOT to complicate the mind further or help sound like an intellectual, but to free the mind from deslusion of self. \n.\nWhat really matters ultimately is your own intuitive realization of Self that lies beyond the concepts & ideas that Yoga philosophy talks about, & this realization arises only through dedicated & long term commitment to\n\u2022 swadhayaya (self-study), \n\u2022 sadhana (living the practice) & \n\u2022 shraddha (faith)", "total_engagement": 1746, "engagement_rate": 0.047965715227603636, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-10-23T02:13:15.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "system", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "philosophy talks", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "concepts & ideas", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "views", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teaching", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "views & counter", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "studying & teaching", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "techniques & theory atheism & theism dualism & monism practicality & spirituality", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "faith & experience", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "krishna bhakti &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "gift", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Beauty & Fitness", "confidence": 0.9944266080856323}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132425891473, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-05T21:14:00.344Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-05T21:14:00.344Z"}, {"id": 607775132425891472, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-375862070", "created_at": "2023-11-05T21:14:00.341Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-05T21:14:00.341Z"}, {"id": 607775132427875659, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-06T03:27:43.493Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-09T03:26:11.682Z"}, {"id": 607775132427875660, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-11-06T03:27:43.509Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-09T03:26:11.688Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175323577011, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cy8fP-vvUKS/", "post_id": "3223588870897353362", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "The scope of sound goes beyond mere communication in Indic tradition\n\nShrimad Bh\u0101gavatam (3.26.33) says\n\narth\u0101\u015brayatva\u1e41 \u015babdasya\ndra\u1e63\u1e6dur li\u1e45gatvam eva ca\ntan-m\u0101tratva\u1e41 ca nabhaso\nlak\u1e63a\u1e47a\u1e41 kavayo vidu\u1e25\n\n\"The learned ones & those with true knowledge define sound as that which conveys the idea of an object, indicates the presence of a speaker, & constitutes the subtle form of ether\"\n\nThus, sound is understood as a medium of communication, expression, & interaction of ideas & emotions. Sound is not mere \"vibration\", but a fabric of interaction\n\nDeep within the belly of every word there is a potent meaning & sense waiting to be deciphered. This sense is called Bh\u0101va, the state of expression (of emotion)\n\nBh\u0101va (\u092d\u093e\u0935) is derived from Sanskrit word \u2018bh\u0101vayanti\u2019, meaning, to pervade. Thus, sense & meaning pervade sound, & Mantra is nothing but codified Bh\u0101va\n\nBh\u0101va enlivens a Mantra. Yes, phonetic correctness & grammatical fineness is important in Veda mantra but nothing can replace the critical importance of Bh\u0101va. (Also, not every Mantra is a Veda mantra). This is why, even Patanjali says, one must do Japa with Bh\u0101va (PYS 1:28)\n\nBh\u0101va emerges from Shraddh\u0101 \u2013 faith/trust/devotion. Bh\u0101va is what makes words powerful & that very word power is used for spiritual evolution in Yogic tradition via Mantra chant, Japa, Bhajan, Kirtan etc\n\nShraddh\u0101 (faith) evokes Bh\u0101va (expression) & Bh\u0101va (expression) invokes Shraddh\u0101 (faith). Sound not only helps us express but also evolve. Bh\u0101va carries Sharddh\u0101 to its peak, i.e., Sharan\u0101gati, total surrender\n\nAccording to the Hindu thought, the world is divided into manifest & unmanifest, & this has direct correlation with sound & silence\n\nSilence always underlies everything that is spoken, & this is why the highest speech is considered to be that which brings the sound back to silence\n\nThis is also the main intent of Yogic scriptures \u2013 to show us how to retract speech into silence\n\nScriptures like the Upanishads indicate that when the mind\u2019s noise is quietened, the sound of silence is heard - which is nothing but Om\n\nMaking the mind silent using sound (Mantra) to reveal the Being beyond the sound is the secret of Mantra Yoga\n\nShare\ud83d\ude4f", "total_engagement": 1411,

This is why traditional Yoga insists on stringent ethical-moral norms (Yama-Niyama), stable faith & unfailing commitment. Modern (popular) Yoga doesn't insist on such pre-conditions\n\nAny claim of teaching \u2018traditional Yoga\u2019 needs to be backed by relevant scriptural citation and/or demonstrated by studentship

In another incident, some participants left the hall because I was wearing Jeans (it was a Yoga talk\ud83e\udd37). Way too many times I\u2019ve been told I don\u2019t look like an authentic \u2018Indian Yogi\u2019 because neither do I wear malas, nor am I thin like the sadhus. Once an organizer expressed doubt over my competence because I didn\u2019t use incense to 'cleanse' her studio before my workshop, & many such incidents\n\nHere's the economics.Consumerism perpetuates stereotypes because stereotypes help boost sales & keep production costs low. Advertising creates demand, perpetuates FOMO, &, we (literally) buy into stereotypes (I am glad this narrative is been challenged over the last few years)\n\nOur choices, sense of style & purchase habits are heavily manipulated by someone sitting in a Boardroom. Look how we are arm-twisted by Social Media companies to express only in ways that help them optimize revenue\n\nTake the example of global yoga clothing market, an industry that majorly perpetuates body stereotypes to boost sales.The industry is projected to grow from $22.72 billion in 2021 to $39.91 billion in 2028 by telling us how we should look, & what we should wear to look the part. I know way too many Yoga enthusiasts who determine their self-worth based on such stereotypes in mainsteam & social media\n\nI remember a line from the movie Fight Club, \u201cThe things you own end up owning you\u2026\u201d\n\nSpirituality is about the 'spirit', stuff is only the aid. Do not allow the aid to become your need. Remember you are consciousness, not a mere customer\n\nAn old Hatha scripture, Dattatreya Yoga Shastra, notes this & says, \u2018The one who is devoid of Yoga practice (sadhana) but only wears signs & attires to show otherwise, the company of such a person should be avoided\u2019\n\nThe way to Self is via sincere Sadhana. If stuff has become more critical than Sadhana, it\u2019s a wake-up call\n\nReflect & Share\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd", "total_engagement": 1543, "engagement_rate": 0.042388945358643994, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-07T10:23:18.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "practice", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "workshop", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "times", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sense", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "jeans", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "incident", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ways", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "style &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "participants", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "clothes", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "europe", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "consciousness", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "india", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga enthusiasts", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "industry", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "many such", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "experiences", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "purchase habits", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "organizer", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mainsteam & social", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sadhana", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sales & keep", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fomo & we", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132448463668, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-13T22:13:06.543Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T22:13:06.543Z"}, {"id": 607775132448463666, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1265460473", "created_at": "2023-11-13T22:13:06.539Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T22:13:06.539Z"}, {"id": 607775132448683815, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-14T03:26:05.164Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-17T03:23:21.129Z"}, {"id": 607775132448683817, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-11-14T03:26:05.188Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-17T03:23:21.138Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175336366235, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CzYf3b3IvWd/", "post_id": "3231472881567462813", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "We all have grown up on the social construct \u2018More is Better\u2019. Consumerism culture thrives on this dictum. We are told, the more you have the better you will be.\n\nThe Yoga practitioner too may unconsciously comes under the influence of such a narrative, thinking that knowing twenty Pranayamas is better than doing two,  doing 10 variations of Suryanamaskar is better than doing one, having multiple certifications is better than having a few, & doing complicated things is more advanced than simple practices\n\nBut, when it comes to Yoga (at least the one that aligns with traditional ethos), More may not necessarily be Better, & Complicated may not always be Advanced. This has been my consistant message in my ongoing Living the Gita course - since we are working  on simplifying our understanding of Yoga\n\nThis is where we need to remember that Yoga is a path of gradual withdrawal or lessening \u2013 a Nivritti M\u0101rga. And, an essential aspect of that is simplification\n\nIf your Yoga is about 'stuff', then surely go ahead & consume more. But, if you seek to explore the core of Yoga, then simplification needs to be woven into your Yoga practice\n\nThe \u2018advance\u2019 of Yoga is not in complexity but in simplicity. How you simplify your life, how you lightening the mind, how you unwind your relations, how you exist in effortlessness, is the key to advancement in Yoga\n\nNeither doing complicated practices nor quoting fancy philosophies necessarily connotes advancement in Yoga. Advanced Yoga is practiced by living life honestly, navigating challenges confidently, accepting success humbly, and opening to the unknown faithfully.\n\nThis is why most Hatha scriptures mention just a few asanas. This is why at the end of explaining everything to Arjuna, Shri Krishna says, \u201cjust surrender to me\u201d. This is why all practices of Yoga are ultimately about how you refine your mind & meditate. This is also why, spiritually evolved Yogis live frugally, with simple needs, but deep contentment\n\nBecoming Simple is the \"advanced\" of Yoga. Allow your Yoga to gradually help you stabilize your mind & simplify your life \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\n\nHas your Yoga practice made your mind calmer and life simpler?\n\n#yogabeyondposes",

Teacher without a firm grounding in Yogic studentship. Are we? \n \nIn Prashna Upanishad, 6 students approach Sage Pippalada for spiritual knowledge. But, the teacher doesn't start teaching right away. He requires them to live with him for a year, lead a life of discipline & practice, to see if they are fit to be taught\n\nIn the Tantric scripture, Tripura Rahasya, Parashurama had to cleanse his mind via Japa for 12 long years before Dattatreya could grant him spiritual knowledge\n\nNot only in India, in every ancient tradition, studentship has been the basis of knowledge transfer. Plato lived with Socrates for 12 years, Aristotle was a student of Plato for 20 years\n\nEven today, in corporate & academic sectors, the junior has to \u2018shadow\u2019 or do \u2018assistantship\u2019 of a senior.\u00a0Apprenticeship is a requirement in every craft, then why not in modern Yoga? \n\nIs it because we are\u00a0so taken by the idea of becoming a Leader, that we have ignored how to be a follower?\n\nTeachers without a firm grounding in study, sadhana & studentship are churned out by the thousands every year by institutions that run YTTs solely to keep their studios running due to economic compulsion. Also, pressure to stay \u201cCertified\u201d has promoted an incessant pursuit of collecting \u2018Hours\u2019 instead of committing to patiently deepening self-knowledge\n\nI hope at the industry level this is given due credence. Till then, let's realize importance of Studentship & work towards cultivating the essence of a Student within. Leaving here my perspective today, on Thursday, the day of the Guru\n \nStudentship is dedicated, disciplined, diligent & faithful commitment to teacher & study over a long period of time. Tips \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd\n\n\u2022 Find teacher/s who can impart theoretical knowledge as well as guide your spiritual growth. (This search will take time)\n\u2022 Once you find such teacher/s, deeply commit to studying with them for a long period of time\n\u2022 Stay humble & see yourself as a student\n\u2022 Be courageous to go through the grind\n\u2022 Stay true to your own Sadhana till teacher appears", "total_engagement": 798, "engagement_rate": 0.021922474657289633, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-09T10:43:20.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "stay", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "grounding", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "students", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teachers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "studentship & work", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "diligent &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "student", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "corporate & academic", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sadhana & studentship", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teacher", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sadhana", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teacher & study", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "institutions", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "discipline & practice", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga teacher", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "knowledge", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132448463685, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-13T22:13:07.133Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T22:13:07.133Z"}, {"id": 607775132448463684, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1476227560", "created_at": "2023-11-13T22:13:07.083Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T22:13:07.083Z"}, {"id": 607775132448683830, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-14T03:26:05.285Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-17T03:23:21.237Z"}, {"id": 607775132448683833, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-11-14T03:26:05.299Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-17T03:23:21.243Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175336366122, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CzfW9xSobG3/", "post_id": "3233404059312566711", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/41d19d66157ba8a66568b2eba907cfd9.JPEG", "phash": "f7412b3f41a27c58", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beard", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3034506142139435}, {"entity": "facial hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21997947990894318}, {"entity": "vehicle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2114596962928772}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8932771682739258}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8847205638885498}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.866773247718811}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2922811806201935}, {"entity": "man", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23693479597568512}, {"entity": "watch", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2260734736919403}, {"entity": "soccer ball", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20570935308933258}, {"entity": "clock tower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20511406660079956}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-14T01:26:01.239Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-27T15:50:44.446Z"}}], "post_text": "hahaha, who else's mind does that ?

"post_text": "Why are many Indian Gods & Goddesses blue in colour?\n\nIn Hinduism, the depiction of Gods and Goddesses, like Krishna, Shiva, Kali etc. with blue skin tone is deeply symbolic and holds a profound cultural and philosophical meaning. Here are a few reasons for representing the divine in Blue colour.\n\nThe colour blue represents the immeasurableness associated with the vastness of the sky and the boundless depths of the ocean. Thus, blue (or its shades) symbolize immeasurable power of the divine. Blue colour also symbolises that the divine permeates the entire universe and signifies that the divine is not confined to a specific form or colour but encompasses the entire universe\n\nBlue and its shades also invite us to immerse ourselves in the shades, to go beyond the shades and into the pure \u2018white\u2019 that denotes transcendence of attributes like name and form. This symbolizes the Yogic journey of a seeker, through the shades of our self- consciousness, and into the realization of the limitless consciousness.\n\nAccording to ancient Indian Mathematics, Ga\u1e47itashastra, the colour blue (N\u012bla) is said to have been used as a symbol for the unknown. And, in Shilpashastra, the ancient Indian science of iconography, blue is referred to as a primary colour which can be used to prepare an infinite number of shades \u2013 thus connoting infinite and unknowable forms of the divine.\n\nDark Blue colour was also used to symbolize the \u2018Dark\u2019 that one has to face and conquer beyond the boundaries of name and form. Eg: Kali and Bhairava are often represented in this context. Also, Shiva turning \u2018blue\u2019 after drinking the Halahala poison is in this context\n\nShare \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe", "total_engagement": 2353, "engagement_rate": 0.06464108128897558, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-14T12:42:46.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "kali", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "colour", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "shiva", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "indian", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "gods & goddesses", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "universe", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "shades", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "meaning", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "krishna", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132470733047, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-22T23:48:09.233Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-22T23:48:09.233Z"}, {"id": 607775132470733046, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "999977335", "created_at": "2023-11-22T23:48:09.193Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-22T23:48:09.193Z"}, {"id": 607775132473533248, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-24T03:45:52.628Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-25T03:45:36.514Z"}, {"id": 607775132473533249, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-11-24T03:45:52.634Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-25T03:45:36.518Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175345777046, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CzrBkb1IdRT/", "post_id": "3236687659025945683", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "Traditional Yogic narrative is full of legends, metaphors, demonstratable accounts & symbolic stories, which do have their place in the larger context of how Yogic tradition views things\n \nPopular Yoga too has followed in the foot steps of its predecessor, but many times the claims made are either cherry-picked, wrongly ascribed or taken out of context\n\nI've heard some unique legends & exaggerated claims over the years. Here are a few,\n\nI have been told by many followers of a popular 'style' of Yoga that, in the \u2018original\u2019 Yoga Sutra, Patanjali had prophesized the birth of their founder. When pointed out that nothing like this is mentioned in the Yoga Sutra, I am told that it is clearly stated in the \u2018original\u2019 Sanskrit text of the Yoga Sutra & that many English translations purposely omit translating this fact due to conspiracy\n\nThen, over multiple times I have heard a claim that \"according to Yoga scriptures, Ajna Chakra is the Pineal Gland, which is the seat of the Soul\". Well, there is not a single Yogic/Tantric scripture (at least to my knowledge) that claims this. If you know one, do let me know. This correlation was a popular idea in Western philosophy & Western occultism though, & thus must have come into popular Yogic narrative. The Greco-Roman physician called Galen, 200 CE, talks about this relation, & so does the famous 17th Century French Philosopher & Mathematician Rene Descartes\n\nThen, there are those ever-popular claims as to how \"Yogic scriptures ask us to wear red clothes & eat red veggies to \"open\" the Root Chakra..\" & so on. This is a highly simplified claim & correlation. Again, if one can back it by citing a legit (authentic) scripture (sh\u0101stra), I am all ears\n\nFriends, we all need metaphors, inspiring stories, analogies & symbolism to help decipher, understand & connect with Yoga. But there is a thin line between legends & metaphors and scripturally backed demonstratable accounts\n\nHow I dream of a time when Critical Thinking becomes an essential part of every Yoga Teacher Training.

This is a legit issue that\u00a0creates self-doubt & hampers them from going out & doing their thing. This is a reassuring post for them\n\nA few weeks ago I saw an advert for a 200-Hour Training that promised to teach 100 asanas & over 20 Pranayamas in a 21-day residential program. I can only imagine the pressure on the students to absorb as much as they can in 21 days because they have come to believe that the more they know the better teacher they will become\n\nThe anxiety of not knowing (enough) is also compounded by the fact that Yoga itself is thousands of year old knowledge system with hundreds of scriptures & dozens of philosophies that one can't keep up with (at least initially)\n\nUpon that, due to commercial pressures of standing out from the crowd & a constant, in-the-face performative Yogic culture that triggers a sense of lack, a Yoga Teacher may feel compelled to keep offering a lot of options & varieties to just stay relevant & retain students\n\nIn short, contemporary Yoga teachers are under tremendous pressure to become \"experts\" fast \n\nLots can be said on this, but today will just leave few tips to help manage this quandary\n\n1) You will never know enough because knowledge is inexhaustible.\u00a0Whats needed is right knowledge, not more knowledge\n\n2) Yes, there are many scriptures of Yoga, but one need not study them all. This is why its crucial to find your teacher & study with them over a long period of time\n\n3) Many techniques are listed in scriptures, but one doesn\u2019t have to teach everything. In ancient times the Guru used to filter & administer specific techniques based on the proclivity of student.

For decades practitioners have broken their backs going 'deep in the pose'\n\nRemember that cult meme of Batman slapping Robin saying \u2018But, I am not flexible\u2026\u2019? How much flexibility would Robin need to pass off as a \u2018Yoga\u2019 practitioner?\n\nYesterday I spoke to someone who is a fitness instructor for 2 decades, a lifelong spiritual seeker, & a graduate of an 18-month Teacher Training but is doubting his capabilities as a Yoga teacher cuz\u2019 he is not \u2018flexible enough\u2019\n\nYes, depth in asana is subjective, but how deep to go in asana should be assessed by an honest Risk v/s Benefit analysis\n\nIf going deep compromises safety, ease of breath, focus of attention & sense of effortlessness, solely to increase the \u2018depth\u2019 of a pose, then such a trade-off is risky\n\nBut performative, picture-video-driven asana culture makes us overlook this & chase an \u2018ideal scenario\u2019 dictated by someone else\u2019s body type (ideally a bendy person) that may not be one's requirement\n\nBlind pursuit of stretching may even make us overlook what type of flexibility we are actually developing, dynamic, static, or ballistic\n\nAlso, let\u2019s face it, our self-esteem is closely attached to our asana performance. Asana practice invariably becomes a pursuit of lifting a sagging self-esteem.\nBetter at poses = Better Yogi = More self-worth, being the correlation. So, a lot of mind games are at play even in a physical practice. So why not work on the mind?\n\nOne can only go so \u2018deep' physically, up to joint range of motion. But, there is another level of \u2018deep\u2019 that awaits us - the depth of self-awareness. Asana practice can help us do that\n\nAsana is a gateway to deeper mental realignment. This is why one important Hatha scripture called Matsyendra Samhita says that the goal of asana is Manah Sthira K\u0101rana, stabilizing the mind\n\nBreathe & move effortlessly in asana, working with acceptance instead of focusing on reaching another pre-established flexibility goal. Let asana practice be a patient journey, not a desperate pursuit\n\nWhat is 'deep' for you in a pose ?", "total_engagement": 685, "engagement_rate": 0.01881816433614461, "network_type": "instagram",

muscles communicate through the zone of sensation. Such communication is a request from the nervous system, asking us to be aware, and may be even restrain ourselves, as we approach the end range\nof motion.\n\nPlease, do not forget this inner communication between your muscles and the nervous system in your Asana practice. Its an extremely crucial component that introduces you to the inner universe.\n\nSome teachers give too many instructions which can distract the students from establishing inner communication. Some teachers even tell their students where and how much to feel, which robs them from finding their own authentic inner connection, and some insist so much on the precision of the shape of an asana that the students get overwhelmed, watching & copying the teacher, trying to fit into someone else's concept of an ideal asana.\n\nSuch strategies restrict the students from experiencing their own subjective 'feel' of the Asana.\n\nIf we want to use asana beyond its physical dimension, and open it up as an inward practice, then its important to tune into our own body's communication mechanism before getting distracted by the teacher's instruction or our own expectation.\n\nOnly then one will be able to establish one's own standard of effort and ease in an asana practice.\n\nRemember, Asana practice can become a beautiful process of education and assurance, where our mind\ntells the muscles..\n\n'It's ok, I am watching over you. Do only what you can.\"\n\nBe responsible, be aware and work with your limitations, not against it.\n\nHow has your asana sadhana helped your inward communication with self ?\n\nShare \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n\n#yogabeyondposes #yogapractise #yogaasana #yogapose", "total_engagement": 1253, "engagement_rate": 0.03442213126013022, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-21T12:09:19.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "students", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teachers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "muscles", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "muscle", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "watching &", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "communication", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "zone", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "yogaasana"}, {"name": "yogabeyondposes"}, {"name": "yogapose"}, {"name": "yogapractise"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132470733061, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-22T23:48:10.541Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-22T23:48:10.541Z"}, {"id": 607775132470733060, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "305212435", "created_at": "2023-11-22T23:48:10.524Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-22T23:48:10.524Z"}, {"id": 607775132473533262, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-24T03:45:52.811Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-25T03:45:36.674Z"}, {"id": 607775132473533263, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-11-24T03:45:52.831Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-25T03:45:36.678Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175345776874, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz9K1ebIlao/", "post_id": "3241794962041493160", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": "{\"id\":\"381493330\",\"has_public_page\":true,\"name\":\"Yogi-sthaan Soulful living.\",\"slug\":\"yogi-sthaan-soulful-living\"}", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "What a lovely Yoga teacher meetup in Bengaluru this evening. \n\nSome are fresh teachers, some are teaching for years, but all are sincere in their seeking and honest in their pursuit - so capable, so charismatic.\n\nWe spoke lots, about our challenges, our own inner journey, how to balance work and sadhana, issues with money, fears of putting ourselves out there, self-doubt, balancing family commitments and professional rigours and so many other topics.

Both pictures are of Jupiter taken 100 years apart. Jupiter did not change, what changed was our vision of Jupiter. With better Vision we gained better understanding of Jupiter. \n\nThis is how broadening our Vision, our Drishti, reveals self and life in its true colours. \n\nThis is why the term Drishti is NOT just about sight, but about the Vision, not only about what the eyes see but about who sees what is shown.\n\nThe most profound Vision is the Vision of Self (\u0101tmadarshana), with which one sees the Atman within all.\n\nHow has your self-perception transformed because of Yoga ?", "total_engagement": 1444, "engagement_rate": 0.03966923985604791, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-23T12:25:40.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "vision", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "jupiter", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "feedback", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "terms", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "self", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "students", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132494858243, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-05T21:23:49.019Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-05T21:23:49.019Z"}, {"id": 607775132494858242, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-39801930", "created_at": "2023-12-05T21:23:49.009Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-05T21:23:49.009Z"}, {"id": 607775132495580444, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-06T03:56:24.355Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-09T03:43:20.016Z"}, {"id": 607775132495580445, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-12-06T03:56:24.361Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-09T03:43:20.023Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175352232475, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C0Ed-q8ISwX/", "post_id": "3243849481675942935", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": "{\"id\":\"393267984400652\",\"has_public_page\":true,\"name\":\"Gokulam, Mysore\",\"slug\":\"gokulam-mysore\"}", "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "Spoke with a group of sincere Yoga teachers in our Yoga Camp today about how seekers & teachers downplay their magnificence just to not come across as being proud or egotistical.

This is made worse especially in spiritual circles where idealistic notions make us feel guilty if we transgress even a bit, making us too hard on ourselves\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see so many capable Yoga teachers underplay their abilities due to fear of being labelled egoistic.

It was clear that she didn\u2019t see the \u2018My\u2019 in both cases\n\nLook, we all have issues with our esteem, confidence, expression, & we need to resolve them gradually with patience & self-compassion\n\nHonest acceptance & patient transformation is the way. But delaying, hiding, repressing or bypassing our issues by using misconstrued spiritual notions is self-sabotage\n\nArjuna could have faked courage just to impress Lord Krishna, but he didn\u2019t.

As \u0101shrams become more like 'cash'rams, its difficult for Indian Yoga students to find unbranded, non-sectarian places of study where knowledge is taught with a critical approach, without the sugar-coated mumbo jumbo\n\nThat's why the name 'Boot Camp' , study training intensive. I know its not 'Yogic' but thats the point \ud83d\ude0a\n\nIn our Camp we approached Yoga in its pre-modern interpretation, sticking closely to its original purpose, as a science of self-understanding, as a study of life, without the fluff, without dilution - busting myths, clarifying hearsay, stirring clear of mysticism, with reverence to the culture & scriptures, & had lots and lots of fun doing that...\ud83e\udd70\n\nSuch dedicated bunch of students came from near and far, and immersed in a loving incubator with ruthless honesty -  crying, laughing, hugging, sharing their deepest fears, holding each other, studying, moving, bending, twisting, empathizing with each other's pains and traumas and going home with a lil' more hope and a lesser self-doubt. \n\nA big thankyou to my dear @rcp_yoga yoga for holding the camp so capably with your knowledge and understanding in your studio  @kurma.shala , and being such an amazing partner in the project. \n\nAnd, for the students.

Go, win the world \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd\n\nAnd, as for more Abhy\u0101sa Boot Camps, for now let me just say, ....this is just the beginning", "total_engagement": 588, "engagement_rate": 0.01615340237905552, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-27T13:13:13.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "model", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "beginning", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "places", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "programs", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "someone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "culture & scriptures &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "boot", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "camp", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "students", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "effort", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "study", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "knowledge", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "setup", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "kurma.shala"}, {"name": "rcp_yoga"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132494858327, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-05T21:23:49.502Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-05T21:23:49.502Z"}, {"id": 607775132494858325, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1774907941", "created_at": "2023-12-05T21:23:49.499Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-05T21:23:49.499Z"}, {"id": 607775132495580450, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-06T03:56:24.404Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-09T03:43:20.067Z"}, {"id": 607775132495580451, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-12-06T03:56:24.413Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-09T03:43:20.072Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175352232473, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C0LFhP3owDd/", "post_id": "3245712231465418973", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "During last three days of our Yoga Camp the problem of too much was talked about a lot.\n\nThere is soooo much to know in Yoga & there is soooo much information out there in the public domain that it can be truly overwhelming and confusing, especially for someone starting off on the path\n\nIn modern spirituality, we are surrounded by a plethora of techniques. We are floating in a sea of information. It is very easy to \u201cknow\u201d. Knowing is just 0.003 seconds away on Google. But, are we really processing & experiencing what we know?\n\nOftentimes, as seekers, we get excited about learning new stuff. Every method feels right & we want to practice everything. But, in our excitement of collecting knowledge we forget to pause & ask, \u201cis it the right teaching for me?\u201d\n\nWe go to different teachers to learn more & more, gather certifications & hours of education, which, on paper, look impressive, but gathering more information & certification neither denotes knowledge, nor connotes spiritual maturity.\n\nUnlike other fields of knowledge, spirituality is not about the width of knowledge but the depth of knowing. Our craving to know more mainly stems from our self-doubt & our impatience.\n\nDon\u2019t romanticize information, do not flirt with knowledge, it will only make you swim on the surface. Be courageous and pursue the One Single Truth (Ekatattva) which will not be known by externalized knowing but by internalized experiencing (Anubhava)\n\nIf your Yogic learning is not helping you Unlearn your self, then that learning is mere decoration - just a performance. \n\nSwelter on the path till you establish self-clarity as to what you want to know & where you want to go. Then, give all you've got to find the teaching and the teacher. Once you find 'your' teacher, steer away from all distractions & dive deeply into the practice & study wholeheartedly with total commitment, faith, and sincerity.\n\nThis is what Traditional Yoga calls \u201cEk\u0101nta\u201d - Single End of seeking.\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb What is your strategy to stay focused amidst the overwhelm of information out there ?\n\nReflect and Share

I've often wondered, what if all philosophies & practices of Yoga that we try (struggle) to engage with lead to an embrace, a warm comforting hug? \n\nWhat if all our spiritual pursuits, challenges & stresses end in a cuddle, a gentle loving cuddle? Beyond terse philosophies & rigid notions of spirituality, what if it all is just a big sigh, a deep rest of sorts in the comforting  arms of the Divine? My Yoga s\u0101dhan\u0101 makes me sink deeper into those arms, more n' more..\n\nSo many mystics, across cultures have expressed their highest spiritual state as a loving embrace from the Divine. The 13th century Yogi Saint, Sant Jnaneshwar expresses his most profound spiritual experience as \u201cshevati vishwarupe mithi det Hari\u201d, meaning, at the end I was embraced by the universal Lord Hari\u201d. Then, we have the 17th century mystic, Saint Tukaram exclaiming lovingly his spiritual enlightenment as \u201cprem rase baisali mithi\u201d, a cuddle filled with nectar of Love\n\nOn the other side of the world, we have the Christian mystic, Saint Angela of Foligno of the 13th century, presenting her enlightenment as \u201cThe embrace of God that produces a light so great that the soul understands the fullness of God's goodness, which it experiences in itself\u201d. Or, the Sufi mystic, Jalalludin Rumi, expressing his unconditional love for the beloved by saying \u201cIn the orchard and rose garden, I see your face. In the shadows of passion, I am embraced by your love\u201d\n\nTruly, a Bhakta (devotee) doesn't care for transcendental experiences. The devotee, in their love for the Divine, manifests the profundity of enlightenment in the here & now. There is nowhere to go & no place to reach for the Bhakta. While philosophers argue & the skeptics debate about what it is & how it is, the Bhakta experiences it right in the heart through total surrender & unashamed love of the beloved Divine. Divinity is always embracing us, we just have to acknowledge it & melt in it. Why struggle when you can snuggle? \n\nHug somebody warmly today\nAssure them with a gentle touch\nComfort them with a cheerful smile\nOur world needs more of it now then ever \n\nI send you all comforting Hugs \ud83e\udd17\n\nShare & pass the hug", "total_engagement": 2154, "engagement_rate": 0.05917419851102992, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-12-05T11:14:02.000Z",

The more comfortable we are with this fact, the easier & exciting our study of Yoga History & Philosophy will be.\n\n\u00b7\u00a0No, Yoga is not only 8 limbs\n\n\u00b7\u00a0No, Yoga is not only of 4 types\n\n\u00b7\u00a0No, Yoga Sutra is not the only book of Yoga philosophy\n\n\u00b7\u00a0No, Sanskrit is not the only language of Yoga\n\n\u00b7\u00a0No, Veda is not the only origin of Yoga\n\n\u00b7\u00a0No, Shiva is not the only God of Yoga\n\n\u00b7\u00a0No, Yoga is not only union\n\nThe most important term in all the above statements is \u2018not only\u2019, because it takes into account the diversity of thought that emerged under the umbrella of Yoga through Indic history and also opens up to context-based interpretation.\n\nThat\u2019s why, when someone asks me a question like \u2018what does Yoga say about XYZ?\u2019 my answer is, \u2018\u2026it depends\u2019 - because, it truly does. Anything & everything in Yoga needs to be interpreted in context, context of time period, language, school of thought, social structure, lineage (sampradaya) and so on.\n\nNote: Contextuality of a subject matter doesn\u2019t mean ambiguity. Just because Yogic ideas can be interpreted in different ways doesn\u2019t give us a licence to interpret them the way we want. The Yogic tradition gives a systematic way of interpreting the terms which needs to be aligned with.\n\nShare and spread the word.", "total_engagement": 2151, "engagement_rate": 0.05909178319276943, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-12-09T13:52:39.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "view", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "body", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "benefit &", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "aspect", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "idea", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fact", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "easier", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "terms", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "anything & everything", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "course", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "history", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga history & philosophy", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "knowledge", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Beauty & Fitness", "confidence": 0.993923008441925}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132513371818, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-13T21:53:42.190Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-13T21:53:42.190Z"}, {"id": 607775132513371817, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "338730152", "created_at": "2023-12-13T21:53:42.186Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-13T21:53:42.186Z"}, {"id": 607775132513534013, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-14T03:41:46.372Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-17T03:54:53.203Z"}, {"id": 607775132513534014, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-12-14T03:41:46.379Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-17T03:54:53.208Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175360985642, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C0q5z2hPuf9/", "post_id": "3254667932612880381", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": ".\n\u2022 Despite being on the path for 10 years I doubt myself\n\u2022 Inspite of daily sadhana, my mind is busy in meditation\n\u2022 Nothing is happening, should I change my practice, or do something different?\n\nWe all have had such thoughts, right? \nWe also beat ourselves, have FOMO or feel left behind\n\nWell, patience is not spoken of much in modern spirituality, but is one the most important virtues to cultivate \n\nSince we live in a material reality that's dictated by time, we also tend to view spiritual development through the lens of time.

A word in Sanskrit may have different meanings depending on the context. That's why a na\u00efve translation of Yogic terms without due consideration to the context & sans reference to the cultural paradigm only handicaps our comprehensive understanding of Yoga\n\nOne common term that I feel is largely misunderstood is Buddhi\n\nBuddhi is usually translated as intellect or reason, which makes people think its about intelligence\n\nWell, yes, Buddhi means intellect & reason but it would be myopic to view Buddhi only in the sense of intelligence, smartness, IQ, scholarship etc.\n\nBuddhi, in its profound sense, is a faculty through which the true nature of our existence is cognized, including the limits of what we know & what we are not. In its refined sense, Buddhi is the ability to discern subtle realities of life\n\nThis is why, according to the S\u0101\u1e45khyak\u0101rik\u0101 (37), Buddhi is responsible for discriminating between prak\u1e5bti & the purusha\n\nBuddhi also connotes presence of mind, & ability to discern, & is therefore one of the foremost abilities the Yoga practitioner has to develop\n\nBuddhi can be hijacked by the lower tendencies (rajasic, tamasic potencies). Buddhi is 'sharpened' through constantly reminding ourselves of our true nature, abiding by ethical practices, keeping the faith, doing s\u0101dhan\u0101 sincerely & above all, embracing life in its bitter-sweetness only to become steady in a stable knowing of what is & what is not \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nShivapur\u0101na says,\u00a0buddhiryasya bala\u1e43 tasya nirbuddhestu kuto balam, i.e., having (refined) buddhi is power, how can one be powerful without buddhi? \n\nThat\u2019s why, the Gita calls the process of sharpening the Buddhi & knowing who one truly is as BuddhiYoga -\u00a0e\u1e63\u0101 te'bhihit\u0101 s\u0101\u1e43khye buddhiryoge tvim\u0101\u1e43 \u015b\u1e5b\u1e47u Gita 2:39\n\nA \u201cBuddhim\u0101na\u201d - the one with refined Buddhi, is the one who operates in the world knowing that the Self is permanent & infinite, thus immunizing against the suffering that the transient world brings\n\nPic: Saraswati, the deity of Buddhi. Look how relaxed & cheerful she looks. Thats the sign of a refined Buddhi\n\nHow do you maintain your sanity in this world ? \ud83d\ude00\nShare \ud83d\udc47", "total_engagement": 521, "engagement_rate": 0.014312793604571303,

I\u2019ve met many who reject their current state of self as (bad) \u2018Ego\u2019, to desperately seek some (good) \u2018True Self\u2019 out there, somewhere, & end up in a state thats neither here, nor there. Such self-rejection births Spiritual Bypassing.\n\nBeyond its popular understanding as self-conceit, \u2018Ego\u2019 is nothing but the \u201cI\u201d or the limited self. It's neither good nor bad. Ego is a place-holder of self-identity. Rejecting, hating, or denying it as bad or evil creates an inner division that is constantly at war with itself\n\nOne CANNOT realize the Higher Self (\u0101tman) without working out the Ego-self (ahamk\u0101ra)\n\nYoga is deeply rooted in acceptance of how & where one is. The entire 1st\u00a0& start of 2nd\u00a0chapter of Gita details Arjuna\u2019s dismal mental state. If Yogic tradition wanted us to look away or deny the present self, then such incidents wouldn\u2019t have been stated\n\nArjuna neither rejects his confused state, which wouod be spiritual bypassing, nor does he fake a positive stance, which could be seen as toxic positivity. He is neither embarrassed by his sorry state, nor does he feel shy in front of his Guru & friend, Krishna. Arjuna embraces his \u2018Ego-self\u2019 totally, & in this totality he is humbled to seek the counsel of Krishna\n\nIn Itih\u0101sa - Pur\u0101na (the epics) one finds many brave men & women, including Gods like R\u0101ma & Krishna, going through their own challenges with complete acceptance of their current state of self. Even Bhakti tradition is full of incidents of sadness, suffering, guilt, regret, the so-called, \u2018shadow emotions\u2019\n\nThere can be no transformation in denial. If one rejects current state of self, as bad \u2018Ego\u2019, then one is rejecting self-transformation itself, cuz\u2019 there can be no transformation without recognition of the Ego-self\n\nYoga is a path of accepting the limited Ego-self, & realizing the True-Self hidden within/by it. A blanket rejection of the limited self as 'bad Ego' will only cause division & anxiety\n\nBe kind, embrace your current state of Ego-self, & transform mindfully, with empathy & faith\n\nWhat practices of self-acceptance have worked for you ? \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc", "total_engagement": 515, "engagement_rate": 0.014147962968050327, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-12-16T10:32:42.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "&", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "state", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "men & women", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "anxiety", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "r\u0101ma & krishna", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "krishna arjuna", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "self", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "guru & friend", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "stance", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "flak &", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "1st & start", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lot", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "many", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "acceptance", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "division", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "somewhere", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Family & Relationships", "confidence": 0.7738068699836731}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132568006560, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-21T23:05:06.063Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-21T23:05:06.063Z"}, {"id": 607775132568006559, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1372378869", "created_at": "2023-12-21T23:05:06.059Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-21T23:05:06.059Z"}, {"id": 607775132593273472, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-28T03:52:41.446Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T04:44:51.061Z"}, {"id": 607775132593273476, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-12-28T03:52:41.463Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T04:44:51.175Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175367600983, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C1AEattIghT/", "post_id": "3260625558184265811", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "We all have heard of the generalized notion that Tantra is body positive & doesn't reject bodily pursuits & pleasures. In fact, such a narrative is the foundational basis of s\u20acxualized Tantra in popular culture. Even some scholars promote a stark binary that Tantra accepts the physical, while Yoga & Vedanta reject it\n\nJust want to state here that one needs to be careful about generalizing ideas from Indic spirituality\n\nThere are Tantric lineages that have sheer disregard for the body. For them body is to be rejected & shunned. Some Tantrics also use extreme body-mortification practices as self-sacrifice. So, (traditional) Tantra doesnt always \u2018pamper\u2019 the body & its pleasures\n\nOver years, I\u2019ve had interesting interactions with some genuine Tantric Sadhus, mainly from 2 Tantric sects that could be considered 'extreme' from modern standards - the Kapalika & Kalamukha\n\nThis is an incident from 2014, during my stay with my teacher who was a Mahant (Abbot of a Monastery)\n\nIt was lunch time, & we were finalizing designs for beds for 2015 Kumbha mela. Suddenly, walked in a Kapalika Sadhu. He was very tall (6.4\u2019), lean, with dreads till his knees, dressed in all black, with many skull necklaces & a human femur in his hand\n\nHe came in straight, stood & shouted a greeting banging his right foot hard on the ground. We all greeted him\n\nWith his blood-shot eyes he asked my teacher, \u2018Kitne Moordey hain yahan?\u2019 which literally means, \u2018How many corpses do you have here?\u2019. We disciples were shocked by his choice of coarse words. But our teacher calmly replied that there were half a dozen in the monastery. Replying with a Hmm, he walked away to the lunch hall (Bhandara) with the same stoic poise he had walked in with\n\nLater, my teacher clarified that he was a high strature Sadhu & that in their Tantric lineage they recognize only 2 levels of beings, ones who are Self-realized & others who are not. Those who are not, are categorized as corpses. We were relieved when the context was clarified\n\nThough such Tantric sects have become rare, one can find some genuine Sadhus if one knows how to\n\nLast year, in Rishikesh, we met this sweet little man dressed up as a Kapalika Sadhu", "total_engagement": 975, "engagement_rate": 0.02678497843465839, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-12-18T16:27:58.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands":

Yes! I am truly enjoying watching this body age. Like a curious child I am amazed at how the body complains at efforts that it once managed with youthful zest. It\u2019s quite an eye-opener to notice how hard it is to drop body-fat now as compared to my competitive bodybuilding days. I chuckle at the fact that I can\u2019t manage activities & effort that were a breeze just a decade ago. I enthusiastically wait to regrow my beard every few months just to be surprised by the growing number of grey hair, &, above all, the gradually receeding hairline, the ever growing crows feet, the sagging skin, pigmentation, the faintly crackling joints, they all have become my besties now. I deeply appreciate how my ageing body has made me value it even more & made me disciplined towards maintaining what I consider my physical \u2018home\u2019 for now\u2026\n\nIn Hatha Yogic terms the body is addressed as a Ghata, a baked clay pot. The pot is said to \u2018house\u2019 contents only for a certain time period. For me, it\u2019s beautiful to see how life entered this pot some decades ago, how life is \u2018life-ing\u2019 itself through the years, & how the pot endures on despite the bruises & batterings.\n\nIn due course, a day will come when this pot will crack & the life within it will be released. Then, life will \u2018life\u2019 itself someplace else - in another pot. I await with curiosity to go through that beautiful process of Death,  the time when this pot will eventually break. Life will go on, repeatedly housing itself in temporary accomodations that are beyond my idea of I, me & myself, & even beyond my concept of 'my body'.\n\nSo sacred is this ritual of Life n' Death for me that being alive has itself become my prayer.\n\nWe all are ageing, willingly or unwillingly. I choose to age willingly with total acceptance of what life presents in its journey, from one pot to the next.\n\n#lifequotes #ageing #yogateacher #lifeanddeath", "total_engagement": 859,

to ask, why are we celebrating the Birthday of a book?\n\nTo know this, we have to understand that Bhagavad Gita is not merely a book, & therefore it shouldn\u2019t be treated like one.\n\nIt is, what is called in the Yogic tradition as, a Sh\u0101stra, i.e., a scripture, a science, technology or methodology.\n\nSh\u0101stra in Sanskrit comes from the etymological root which means, the one that releases via its teachings.\n\nSo, this scripture has a clear purpose, i.e., to release the individual from their own misconceptions of self.\n\nTherefore, it is not to be merely read (like a book), but is to be studied, practiced and reflected upon continuously till the goal that it promises is reached.\n\nI have been delving into chanting, study & practice of the Bhagavad Gita for the last 40 years now, and in my own experience, I have seen Bhagavad Gita work like an Algorithm. Algorithm in the sense that as I have grown with the Gita, it has revealed to me exactly what I need.\nThree decades ago the Gita revealed to me what I needed as a teen, then it revealed to me what I needed as a youth, now it helps me consolidate my life through existential insights \u2013 the same Gita, has always given me answers and solutions for where I am at. Thus, for me, the Gita has always been responsive and receptive.\n\nFor this very reason, Bhagavad Gita is considered a compassionate mother, because she knows what to give to her child for it to flourish, & in this sense, the Gita Sh\u0101stra is addressed as a Goddess.Today is the birth of this deity, Mother Gita.\n\nI have much to say, but will end for now with a short quote by Gandhi that echoes the above point,\n\n\u201cThe Gita is the universal mother. She turns away nobody. Her door is wide open to anyone who knocks.\u201d\n\nGreetings on Gita Jayanti \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n\nHow have the teachings of the Gita helped you ?", "total_engagement": 451, "engagement_rate": 0.012389769511826599, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-12-22T17:07:48.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "goal", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "study & practice", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "root", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mother", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "birthday", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bhagavad gita jayanti", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "flourish", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132597996394, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-29T21:28:59.744Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T21:28:59.744Z"}, {"id": 607775132597996393, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "2011200429", "created_at": "2023-12-29T21:28:59.705Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T21:28:59.705Z"}, {"id": 607775132600464261, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-30T14:14:36.888Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-01T03:42:43.207Z"}, {"id": 607775132600464262, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-12-30T14:14:36.893Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-01T03:42:43.211Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175383565298, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C1MwG_bIzCY/", "post_id": "3264195416587186328", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "\u201cWhose family doesn\u2019t have faults?

The author of this treatise, Chanakya, was one of the wisest men of ancient India. He lived around 4 century BC and was a philosopher, scholar, political adviser, logician, economist and a statesman. Though a spiritual scholar on one end, he was also a down right practical person on the other. His advice, given way back in 4th Century BC, is still so relevant. \n\nFriends, Relax ! Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. Its okay to not be okay today. Tomorrow is a new day to create a new reality. Get up, dust yourself, and move on. After all, we are all a Work In Progress.\n\nDon\u2019t whip yourself because you are not perfect, no one is. Everyone has their troubles and everyone has their struggles. So, don\u2019t focus on faults, don\u2019t spend energy on defects, don\u2019t keep reminding yourself of your shortcomings.

He is the primary deity of most renunciate ascetics, Yogis & Sadhus. This \u2018teacher of teachers\u2019 is so important that even the incarnating Gods go to him for knowledge\n\nHe cannot be understood as a concept, only as consciousness. One can only cognize him by becoming him. He is the original anti-authority of Yogic culture, taking all concepts & turning them on their head for us to emerge out of our minds. As a principle, he is the Avadhoot of Tantrics, the Aulia of Sufis, the holy-fool of Christians & the crazy oracle elder of the indigenous tribes of the world\n\nHe makes the seeker challenge norms, breaks their mindset & unwrap what lies within. Only beyond mind does his domain begin, if you can get there through self-effort & grace, you are welcome, or else, find yourself someone else\n\nHe is a strict disciplinarian, yet his love is as tender as that of a mother\u2019s hug. He does not molly-coddle, yet his is the most secure lap to rest your head-on. He topples every ladder, he demolishes every structure that emerges from the recesses of mental constructs, that\u2019s how he works. Words, language, scriptures & holy books squirm at his feet for he is beyond any tangible expression. He is represented as a wanderer ascetic yet he is the stable foundation of Yogic knowledge system. He is only accessible through Tapas, no non-sense view of life, sharp intellect & naked devotion of a loving heart\n\nHe inspires through perplexing ways, he teaches with the strictest of discipline, he guides with a keen eye of a parent and he supports with unconditional love. In this sense, he truly is the Guru of the Gurus\n\nWhere will you find him?, only in your heart. How will you reach him? only by strongest of Vairagya - dropping all that you are not. Silence is his expression, solitude is his abode. He is never in the grey, yet you find him when you go beyond the black and white\n\nMy salutations to Datta Guru, today & always. Thank you for holding my hand & showing me the way. All that I am is because of him.

It\u2019s good to have goals & pursue them, but we need to be aware of a few things here\n\nFor decades I used to make New Year resolutions out of a sense of inner lack. My low self-esteem would unconsciously compel me to raise bench-marks so high that they would be beyond my reach. The lesser I felt about myself, the higher the bench mark would be. I would strive hard, give it all that I had got, but would either exhaust myself or inadvertently give up and fall into the puddle of guilt and resentment. Every New Year Resolution would thus result in lowering my confidence and my sense of inner lack would sink further\n\nUsing the wisdom of Yoga philosophy helped a lot to resolve this issue. I learned the secret of Small Steps \u2013 to create goals not to fill the inner void of low self-esteem but for the sheer joy of experiencing a newer dimension of myself\n\nHere are some realizations and reflections that have helped me, hope they help those who are in similar situation\n\n1) When I would catch myself rushing to set new goals, I would ask myself, \u2018What\u2019s the rush?\u2019. This would help me pause, reflect on my impulsiveness and be patient \n\n2) Don\u2019t do what you don\u2019t enjoy. If you have to do it anyway, learn to enjoy it, or be clear about that fact that you have to do it even though you dont enjoy it\n\n3) Before setting goals be very, very objective about your circumstances and capabilities. Be realistic and deeply reflect on the impulse and sense of lack that\u2019s making you set goals. Your goals should be \u2018your's\u2019, they should neither be compelled by social trends nor be pushed by peer pressure, especially stuff of social media\n\n4) Realize that you cannot achieve everything all the time, there is no need to have everything or please everyone. You don\u2019t have to be perfect, you just have to be your self\n\n5) Above all, remember that every long journey is made up of smaller steps. You can realize lofty goals by breaking them into smaller parts and pursuing them joyfully without anxiety\n\nTake it easy, easy does it \n\nShare this with friends\n\nHappy New Year \u2764\ufe0f\n\n#yogaphilosophy #yogabeyondposes #lifequotes", "total_engagement": 900, "engagement_rate": 0.024724595478146205, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2024-01-02T01:59:29.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "sense", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reach", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lack", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goals", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "resolutions", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "lifequotes"}, {"name": "yogabeyondposes"}, {"name": "yogaphilosophy"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132608669343, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-06T04:11:05.821Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-06T04:11:05.821Z"}, {"id": 607775132608669342, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-521255605", "created_at": "2024-01-06T04:11:05.810Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-06T04:11:05.810Z"}, {"id": 607775132609274977, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-07T03:45:46.513Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-09T03:51:48.468Z"}, {"id": 607775132609274978, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2024-01-07T03:45:46.517Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-09T03:51:48.472Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175390113455, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C1t6JtcoeUi/", "post_id": "3273528258139907362", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": ".\nI do handstand, therefore I am fit.\nI run marathon, therefore I am fit.\nI deadlift 400 lbs, therefore I am fit.\nI have six pack, therefore I am fit.\nI do 3 min. planks, therefore I am fit.\n.\nAbove generalizations are uni-dimensional but Fitness is not. These goals are fine as far as self-motivation goes, but they are in no way a reflection of general fitness. I have seen bodybuilders who can\u2019t sprint even for a minute. I have met marathoners stiff as a tree trunk. I have met anorexic teenagers proud of their six-pack and I have also met hand-standing Yogis who couldn\u2019t sit still for 5 mins.\n.\nGeneral fitness is an overall state of physical wellbeing which is a fine balance between aspects of mind, body, lifestyle, habits and inner peace. Fitness is a whole, not a part.\n.\nFitness extends beyond the physical; it encompasses mental well-being, emotional resilience, and overall vitality. To truly embrace fitness, we must view it holistically, recognizing the interconnectedness of mind, body, and spirit, fostering a balanced and sustainable approach to our well-being.\n.\nMost importantly, I feel, the definition of Fitness is highly personalized. Sports persons have their own definition of fitness, their own benchmarks, which may not be practical for non-sports persons. \n.\nWhy am I saying all this? \n....because social media, which I feel is an amazing resource for self-motivation, has unfortunately become a source for blind pursuit of fitness trends without consideration to personal ability.\n.\nJust cuz some one is deadlifting, you dont have to \nJust cuz someone ran a marathon, you dont have to\n.\nRecognize what is it that will make you healthy & puruse that specific goal over time, as a lifestyle & not as a trend\n.\nIf getting fit is your new year\u2019s resolution, please make sure you consult a personal trainer / sports coach / gym instructor or expert in the fields that you seek to pursue and get an initial assessment done before you start off. \n.\nAbove all, do it for yourself and not for Likes on social media or as a trend that everyone is doing\n\nPlease Share", "total_engagement": 302, "engagement_rate": 0.008296475371555726, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2024-01-05T11:43:19.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "reflection", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fitness", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "state", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "pack", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lifestyle & not", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "social media", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fitness", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "marathoners", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yogis", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teenagers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goals", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& puruse", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "healthy", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sports persons", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "marathon", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Beauty & Fitness", "confidence": 0.9294666051864624}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132616094562, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-17T20:55:43.321Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-17T20:55:43.321Z"}, {"id": 607775132616094561, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1520421320", "created_at": "2024-01-17T20:55:43.317Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-17T20:55:43.317Z"}, {"id": 607775132616493748, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-18T03:36:45.571Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-21T03:39:22.580Z"}, {"id": 607775132616493749, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2024-01-18T03:36:45.576Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-21T03:39:22.586Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175390113454, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C14S8mTI2UH/", "post_id": "3276452058041115911", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "Many Yoga practitioners limit themselves only to physical practices because they link Yoga to their idea of \u2018God\u2019, & therefore to an organized religion. I understand many may not have had comfortable experiences with an idea of \u2018God\u2019 &/or institutions of \u2018God\u2019 (organized religion) & therefore it's natural that they project their anxieties or views on Yogic spirituality\n\nBut, 'God' is a fluid concept & there's no single, specific idea of \u2018God\u2019 in Yogic knowledge systems. Followers of opposing views of \u2018God\u2019 have thrived side by side in India over millennia. Even Gita allows for such freedom of interpretation, Krishna says in 4:11, \u201cHowsoever they seek Me, even so, do I approach them. All follow My path in every way\u201d\n\nThis fluidity is because Yoga is primarily a pursuit of absolute Truth (Sat), not necessarily a pursuit of \u2018God\u2019. But, since the Truth takes the form of \u2018God\u2019/\u2018Gods\u2019 Yoga can be seen as a pursuit of Truth and/or of \u2018God\u2019\n\nTraditionally, view of \u2018God\u2019 depends on Yogic lineage. Here are some diverse ideas across Veda & Tantra. One can choose any to grow spiritually, for it\u2019s not about who one worships, but how the worship transforms the seeker\n\n\u2022 Theism (Bhakti lineages)\n\u2022 Polytheism (Hindus worship many deities)\n\u2022 Monotheism (Vaishnava, Shaiva lineages)\n\u2022 A-theism (Sankhya, Bauddha)\n\u2022 Deism (nature deities like river goddesses)\n\u2022 Pantheism (Vedic Gods permeating the universe/nature\u2013 like Sun God, Surya Dev)\n\u2022 Divine as human/animal forms (Krishna/Saints/Hanuman)\n\u2022 Divine without form, as Absolute consciousness (Brahman)\n\u00b7\u00a0God as Creator, Sustainer, Destroyer\n\u2022 God as a principle (Tattva)\n\u2022 God as one\u2019s own Guru, child, lover, friend, mother, father & also the guest\n\u2022 Spiritual illusion too is considered a Goddess (Maya-Shakti)\n\u2022 Most importantly, God in each one of us, in hearts of all (says Krishna in Gita)\n\nLet ideas of \u2018God\u2019 not stop you from embracing Yoga. There are diverse views of Divine in Yoga for all\n\nEven if one doesn't want to prescribe to any view, one's own undeniable (Self) existence itself is \u2018God\u2019, the Truth (Sat)\n\nNothing is not Divine, nothing is not \u2018God\u2019, nothing is not \u2018Truth\u2019 in Yoga - I find such a broad view very liberating", "total_engagement": 1391, "engagement_rate": 0.038213235900112635, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2024-01-09T12:32:23.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "practices", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "father &", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "idea", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "truth", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "veda & tantra", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "god", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "religion", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga practitioners", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "\u2019", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "experiences", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "many", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "concept", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "institutions", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "& theres", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Family & Relationships", "confidence": 0.891217052936554}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132616094568, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-17T20:55:43.425Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-17T20:55:43.425Z"}, {"id": 607775132616094567, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "171803351", "created_at": "2024-01-17T20:55:43.421Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-17T20:55:43.421Z"}, {"id": 607775132616493750, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-18T03:36:45.594Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-21T03:39:22.607Z"}, {"id": 607775132616493751, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2024-01-18T03:36:45.599Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-21T03:39:22.613Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175390113453, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C16sObsoQA3/", "post_id": "3277126184724398135", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "The other day I saw a sponsored post \u2013 \u201cDo Camel pose to cure back-pain\u201d - how simple it sounds, right ?\nBut is it really ?\n\nHuman individual is not so simplistic that we make blanket statements like the above.

practice) for the highs that the role brings.\n.\nIts clear - one can't expect benefits from Yoga if one is not willing to invest in a diligent sadhana\n.\nA diligent sadhana infuses energy that helps one stabilize in the role of a Yoga teacher. Ignoring sadhana could lead to professional burnout, physical fatigue, mental exhaustion and an eventual self-dissatisfaction with the thought of teaching.\n.\nTeaching Yoga should be looked at as a natural and joyous output of sadhana. You teach out of what you learn from your Sadhana and Study. \nSo, fill your cup first.\n.\nOne cannot be a teacher without being a student first and, for a student, the sadhana is the most precious source of wisdom.\n.\nPrioritize sadhana over teaching. See yourself as a student first, for a long time, till teaching becomes an inner calling and not an outer compulsion. \n.\nFocus on transforming yourself first and inspiring others will naturally happen.\n.\nYour sadhana is the bridge to the Self. It will help you deal with challenges that your roles and responsibilities bring.\n.\nYes, the glamour of teaching is exciting but it is nothing compared to the self-empowerment that sadhana takes you towards.\n.\nThere can be no yoga professional without first being a yoga practitioner. \u2764\n.\nSo, did you do your sadhana today ? \ud83d\ude0a\n.\nShare with fellow seekers \n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n #yogabeyondposes #yogaindia #yogateacherlife", "total_engagement": 1561, "engagement_rate": 0.04288343726820692, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2024-01-14T15:17:34.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "note", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sadhana", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teaching", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "indian", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "energy", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "role", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "highs", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reminder", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yoga teacher", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "yogabeyondposes"}, {"name": "yogaindia"}, {"name": "yogateacherlife"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132616094584, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-17T20:55:44.214Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-17T20:55:44.214Z"}, {"id": 607775132616094583, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-92613680", "created_at": "2024-01-17T20:55:44.211Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-17T20:55:44.211Z"}, {"id": 607775132616493758, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-18T03:36:45.682Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-21T03:39:22.711Z"}, {"id": 607775132616493759, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2024-01-18T03:36:45.686Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-21T03:39:22.716Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175390904843, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C2M7TZoowVX/", "post_id": "3282259046385780055", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "There you go, I said it. Wanted to address this issue since some time.\n\nAs Yoga teachers we love teaching Yoga & guiding people. We identify with it as our purpose etc. It\u2019s all good, but some amount of caution needs to be exercised.\n\nHere is something I want to ask you all, because this important topic is never discussed in Yoga Teacher Trainings. Teachers are not taught how to handle success & failure as professionals.\n\nSo, here is my question.\n\nHave you been using your Yoga and/or Spiritual work for self-worth & self-esteem boost? Has Yoga teaching become a crutch for you to feel good about yourself?\n\nIt could have happened unconsciously, but here is why doing that may not be good for your mental health.\n\n\u2022 External Dependency\n\nIf approval from students becomes the primary source of validation it could lead to emotional dependencies, creating emotional ups and downs based on external feedback. Eg: More sign-ups for a workshop makes one feel worthy, less sign-ups creates worthlessness.\n\n\u2022 Exhaustion & Disillusionment\n\nConstantly tying self-worth to the success of yoga teaching may lead to burnout. Disillusionment may arise if classes don't meet expected standards. Overcommitting to teaching classes or pushing oneself beyond healthy limits in the pursuit of validation can compromise physical and mental well-being.\n\n\u2022 Identity Entanglement\n\nIdentifying too closely with the role of a yoga teacher (asmita) may result in an entanglement of personal identity with professional success & worthiness. This can make it hard to separate one's sense of self from the demands and expectations of the teaching role.\n\n\u2022 Feeling Inauthentic\n\nGenerating self-worth primarily through yoga teaching can influence teaching authenticity due to not being in one\u2019s own clarity. There may be a tendency to follow social trends & teach what others are teaching rather than offering genuine, honest guidance based on personal experience, thus potentially compromising the quality of teaching.\n\nPlease reflect on how you handle your Yoga Teaching work and your esteem dependencies on it, and seek help if needed.\n\nShare with fellow Yoga teachers
