There is always so much I want to say to you each year on your birthday. Yesterday you fell asleep on my lap and I was holding your hand and when I looked down I ached, your hand looked different, like a real person, not a baby. I tried to imagine if I could pick out your hand in a line up of hands, I wasn't sure, you're changing and growing that quickly. \n\nEach year you're more you, more of a person with opinions, ideas, creations and most of all, emotions. All of it gets bigger and more complicated but that much more incredibly you. And each time I don't quite get it, or don't understand the way I usually always did, I tell myself that's a good thing, you shouldn't just be \"figured out\" all the time. You are anything but simple and easy, and in the absolute best way. \n\nAs I'm writing this I'm thinking about how I so want to get it all perfect for you. But then I remember how hard I am working on showing you that perfect isn\u2019t the way. How we both work on that. \n\nI've said this before but you have truly shown me that everything I believe in when it comes to raising thoughtful, caring, empathetic children is real. You are all of those things and more.\n\nYour teachers and I even thought of making you a box for you to go through when all of it feels like too much. When I see how deeply you feel, I relate to it so much and also sometimes worry you feel too much. But then I know that anyone in your life is and will be lucky to know you because of this. When I said happy birthday to you today you said \"don't worry mommy, I'm still your baby!\" \n\nThis morning you somehow were in our bed and I woke up to you examining my face, touching it and smiling. I would've woken up in a panic that I had fallen asleep without doing the millions of things I had planned to do but instead, I woke up to you accepting and loving me exactly like that. You always know. \n\nHappy Birthday to the most caring 5 year old I have ever known. I love you my love. #5", "total_engagement": 1398, "engagement_rate": 0.01402980581062773, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-01T00:12:39.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "hand", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "birthday", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tess alexandra", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "anything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "5"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132068056338, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:02.330Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:02.330Z"}, {"id": 607775132068056336, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1940331287", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:02.328Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:02.328Z"}, {"id": 607775132203564085, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:43.680Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-26T09:29:20.520Z"}, {"id": 607775132203564086, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:43.686Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-26T09:29:20.528Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175092941809, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ClqtOOrrrKW/", "post_id": "2984396593017303702", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/5794cbe5cf7d594210a1a71cb2d2b9eb.JPEG", "phash": "bedc8368176c6385", "image_entities": [{"entity": "child", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7037976384162903}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.41814905405044556}, {"entity": "sweatpant", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3781742453575134}, {"entity": "footwear", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3744564652442932}, {"entity": "pink", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34149858355522156}, {"entity": "play", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24715739488601685}, {"entity": "product", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24588912725448608}, {"entity": "toddler", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20780937373638153}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9919869899749756}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9866021871566772}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9797938466072083}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9728618264198303}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8688068985939026}, {"entity": "luggage & bags", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7480274438858032}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-06T15:18:34.202Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-22T01:18:16.961Z"}}], "post_text": "Yesterday at a school visit, Tess was painfully shy, wouldn\u2019t even say her name or hello. It took everything in me not to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, she\u2019s just shy\u201d or \u201cshe\u2019s slow to warm up.\u201d \u2063I let her be her, and she did warm up. We talked after about that initial feeling she had.\n\u2063\nOne time a a mom wrote to me. She told me that her daughter wouldn\u2019t engage with her great grandmother on FaceTime. She said her husband would said \u201csorry grandma, she\u2019s just shy!\u201d This mom asked me if this was ok and if not, how to message to him why he shouldn\u2019t do this. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nThere\u2019s a few of reasons why labeling our child (and apologizing for it) can turn into our child feeling a certain way about themselves. They\u2019re being told or hearing that they\u2019re shy, that it\u2019s something to be sorry for, so that\u2019s what they\u2019ll believe they are instead of learning things about themselves. Saying about our child \u201csorry she\u2019s shy\u201d is missing an opportunity to connect more meaningfully \u201cIt feels different to talk to great grandma through the phone, and hard to do too!\u201d\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nIt also comes down to this: when we say \u201csorry, she\u2019s X\u201d why are we apologizing for who our children are? Why do we make excuses for how they\u2019re feeling? Do we want them to grow up apologizing for being who they are?\u00a0\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\n\u2063I personally never want to apologize for my children\u2019s emotions OR behavior.

we\u2019re working on it.\u201d\u2063\n\u2063\nTry:\u2063\n\u201cYou can say hi if you want to, or wave, or high five, whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d\u2063\n\u2063\nUpon leaving after a meltdown

Don\u2019t do that!\u201d \n\nA few minutes later we were on our way and more calm, kind of acting as if nothing happened.

That\u2019s what we often don\u2019t realize. You can\u2019t train a child through that. You can help a child get acquainted, comfortable and learn to trust their body but you can\u2019t train them to (without controlling them entirely).\n\nNell had withholding patterns since she was a few months old. I knew and wanted this to be a process that was led by her. Even now, we are working on her getting comfortable with other bathrooms besides the one at home. Somehow, today, she successfully went @pretusa and was cheered by the employees as we walked out (they heard me singing a version of the song in this reel). \n\nI wish I could tell you exactly what to do but I believe that your child will lead you - just like Nell led me. This process was a labor of love, we got closer, we connected and I spent endless time sitting in her bathroom with her where I wrote this song. Maybe it will help one of you too.

As she gets older, it gets harder sometimes to encourage her to keep going.  I shared this video in the past, but I am sharing an updated one now. This is a reminder to us all. Grit is important.\u2063\n\u2063\nThis video demonstrates how patience, perseverance and the ability to struggle is evident even in the youngest children. Sometimes, the hardest part is \ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c and \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b willingness to let the struggle unfold, to see that young babies, toddlers and children aren\u2019t as helpless as we think they are. Infants and toddlers aren\u2019t suffering just because they are working hard (actually, sometimes that\u2019s what they enjoy!).\u2063\n\u2063\nIt\u2019s also about more than just struggling in play, but also how we model responding to life\u2019s struggles. I\u2019m often asked, \u201chow do toddlers learn patience? My toddler is so easily frustrated!\u201d The answer is that they learn this when someone is patient with them. I definitely lose my patience sometimes, jump in too soon, distract, redirect vs. allow things to run their course whether it be a tantrum or struggle to reach for a toy. However, when our overall approach is to convey to our children that we can support vs. fix, \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26 \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26, we can really see the bigger picture and \u201csit on our hands\u201d a moment longer. \u2063\n\u2063\nDisclaimer: it is never too late to work on this.\u2063 Share this with family members or caregivers too!

When he left and we hugged goodbye, I felt like I got a dose of medicine. I realized two things: We need to normalize needing a parent (or any caregiver) for our children. We need to normalize it so that they grow up not afraid to ask for help. I think of how often we muscle through things without asking for help, letting it eat us up inside..

Whenever we feel like we\u2019re giving up so much for our children, that we\u2019re self sacrificing, when we exude this, bicker with our spouse in front of them about it, the more likely our children will grow up feeling like a burden. A travel day here and there is different from complaining about how hard it all is all. the. time. \u2063\n\u2063\n2. Have realistic expectations. Travel with young kids won\u2019t be easy. Don\u2019t anticipate lounging and reading a book on the beach. Anticipate getting in the sand with them. The more your expectations match reality the less disappointed and more appreciative you are for the time together on an adventure. \u2063How do you want your children to embrace trips? With anxiety or with excitement for adventure? (Even when things go wrong!) \n\u2063\n3. Think about when you really have to say no. If your child wants some extra snacks, wants to run around at the gate, wants to touch the escalator railing, it\u2019s. ok. Save your no\u2019s! There\u2019s bound to be a lot. Children hear it a lot. Even if it\u2019s not a blunt \u201cno\u201d just don\u2019t correct and manage as much. Just like we let ourselves indulge more on vacation, instead of saying as many \u201cno\u2019s\u201d just let some of it go. You\u2019ll have more fun, and your kids will too. More fun = less stress.\u2063\n\u2063\nIf we can really shift our mentality to embrace all three of these things, it can turn into this: no one is a burden, traveling is an adventure and there\u2019s some hard parts but we\u2019re in it together. Doesn\u2019t that mentality feel so much better to start a trip?\u2063\n\u2063\nBut also, when does the fun start?! \ud83d\ude02\u2063", "total_engagement": 745, "engagement_rate": 0.007476541723117066, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-18T18:04:57.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "jokes", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "adventure", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "expectations", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "audio", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "front", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "spouse", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "children", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bicker", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "kids", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132068056558, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:03.752Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:03.752Z"}, {"id": 607775132068056556, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-476365206", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:03.747Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:03.747Z"}, {"id": 607775132203564221, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:44.189Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-26T09:29:20.934Z"}, {"id": 607775132203564225, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:44.214Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-26T09:29:20.941Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175101546432, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CmZY7tVtFda/", "post_id": "2997536683239692122", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/7e83350f972b0d9d7309dce712db5213.JPEG", "phash": "bad4871c476ea287", "image_entities": [{"entity": "child", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5434642434120178}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3665878474712372}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.26727041602134705}, {"entity": "play", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.26326367259025574}, {"entity": "product", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2436431348323822}, {"entity": "turquoise", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24127356708049774}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9764400124549866}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8062381744384766}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7515386343002319}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7468836307525635}, {"entity": "skirt", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7416245341300964}, {"entity": "skirt", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5887420773506165}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5690840482711792}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5398252606391907}, {"entity": "shorts", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4122556149959564}, {"entity": "staircase", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.37397775053977966}, {"entity": "gate", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.25171995162963867}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2204645574092865}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-06T14:49:59.281Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-01T20:31:36.146Z"}}], "post_text": "I dont ask my kids to share. And they \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28 share.\n\nYesterday my 3 year old niece came to our hotel and the girls were SO happy. When we got to the room Tess took out the three costumes we brought. Two Elsa costumes and one Ariel costume. Tess and Nell put on their Elsa costumes and then my niece started to cry that she didn\u2019t have one. Tess then hesitatingly says \u201cok\u2026i\u2019ll give her mine.\u201d We all showered Tess with \u201cthat is SO nice Tess! Wow, what a good girl\u201d type comments. It felt wrong to me. Tess proceeded to take off her dress and the moment my niece put it on, Tess burst out crying. I took Tess aside and said \u201cTess, I know you wanted Cece to be happy, but you don\u2019t have to take off your dress to make her happy, we can figure out something else. Do you want to give her your dress or do you want to wear it more?\u201d She said \u201cI want to wear it more.\u201d I said \u201cOk so next time you can think of what you want and if what you want is to give the dress, you do that, if it isn\u2019t, then we can figure out another plan.\u201d\n\nWe ended up putting all the Elsa dresses away until the next day when my niece brought her own. The moral of the story is: If we keep asking our children to give up the metaphorical \u201cshirt of their back\u201d for the sake of others happiness, we are essentially raising children to be what we are trying so hard to undo in ourselves, people pleasers who don\u2019t speak up for what they want. \n\nAlso, would we take off our shirt if our friend wanted to wear it?! WTF! This isn\u2019t how we teach sharing - we teach authentic sharing by considering everyone in the scenario and generosity and empathy in an appropriate manner. Because sharing isn\u2019t as simple as just giving up something of yourself for the happiness of others, sharing is personal, nuanced, dependent on circumstances and settings.

We take for granted that when you don\u2019t let that happen, when you actually let yourself think about and reflect on those moments, it becomes your guide book.\n\nFollow me: Tess wanted plain pasta with butter for lunch yesterday. Nell wanted sauce. So I got buttered pasta with sauce on the side. The pasta came and I split up the pastas. I am a sauce fanatic so I got really excited about the sauce and started having some dipped in sauce. I was loving the sauce with Nell and laughing at how we ate some of it as soup. A few minutes later I ate a bite of Tess\u2019s and there was sauce on my fork. Tess freaked out about the sauce on her pasta and wouldn\u2019t stop \u201cno there\u2019s still some sauce on that one! ahhhh\u201d I said \u201cTess enough, stop.\u201d She stopped. \n\nI don\u2019t say this out of guilt, I don\u2019t feel guilt, I feel human. But I essentially slammed her emotional door.\n\nTess stopped complaining but imagine what it probably felt like. Her warm, loving and comforting mom suddenly turning cold like that. I didn\u2019t yell, I just told her there was a time limit on her discomfort. I thought about what triggered me:\n\nthat it wasn\u2019t such a big deal, that she was being that picky child who wasn\u2019t going to eat if there was a morsel of sauce, that she was fixating, that she was obsessing, and being ungrateful. But she wasn\u2019t being any of those things. She probably felt left out of the sauce party that Nell and I were having. Or maybe she took pride in her non sauce pasta and I ruined that. Or maybe she was just really really tired. \n\nAll I know is that if I don\u2019t reflect on those moments, even hours later, it can quickly become normal, habitual, reflexive, to slam that \u201cstop, it\u2019s enough\u201d door. I never want that to happen. Where does all the stuff go behind that slammed door? It re opens years later as someone who doesn\u2019t feel comfortable expressing how they feel in a relationship because \u201cit\u2019s too much\u201d and they\u2019ve been told \u201cto stop\u201d when it\u2019s too much. \n\nMy thoughts and alternatives to this experience are in the scroll above.

I literally stared at them walk out of class down the street asking myself \u201chow do they have it all figured out?\u201d \n\nSo this feeling right here, in this reel, when you figure something out - you know the one - you feel like an actual super star. It\u2019s not about realizing I can use the Starbucks mobile app to actually get coffee before a flight, or that I have a contraption that fits through the aisles with both girls, it\u2019s about feeling like \u201cyou have it down.\u201d\n\nWhen Nell was born, I would think about how I had just gotten to a stage with Tess where things finally felt manageable. And then I was going to have a newborn and it would be so long til I felt that again. While I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever say I have it \u201call figured out,\u201d I do feel that if we forgot everything, we\u2019d figure it out - Tess would say something like \u201cdon\u2019t worry mommy, we don\u2019t need those things, we can do XYZ!\u201d and she\u2019d come up with some idea that would bring me back to remembering what parenting is about\u2026.\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude39\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude28 \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35 even if it feels like all we\u2019re ever doing is putting out fires. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nDuring a moms groups once, a mom said \u201cJennie, please tell us, when do we figure it all out?!\u201d and I said, with a smile, \u201cI don\u2019t think we ever do.\u201d I think we have moments but all the in between we should stop trying to figure it all out and accept that humans aren\u2019t meant to \u201cfigure out\u201d maybe just the logistics are.

Because we learn to put aside, suppress or distract from hard truths. One hard truth is to acknowledge where we didn\u2019t turn out ok. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we\u2019re not \u201cnormal\u201d or that we are not \u201csane,\u201d it means we are human. No human is perfect or ok in every single area of their life. There\u2019s always a corner that we struggle in. But so many of us never go to that corner, but that corner is always there and when we never go there, we never grow as a person, but also as a parent. We continue to stay away from that corner and then our children grow up to never go to that corner either. What a lot of people have learned to do, over time, is to suppress or distract from really hard emotions, and that turns into something - something that is actually \ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2c.\u2063\n\u2063\nThe other day, I had a tough moment with Nell.

I need help to calm down!\u201d \u2063\n\u2063\nIt stopped me dead in my dysregulated tracks and I was floored that my child, only on this earth for 3 years, was able to, in the midst of emotional chaos, recognize what she needed. Instead of swallowing, suppressing, muscling through - she said what most of us are unable to say even at 30, 40, 50, 60 years old. \ud835\uddea\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc29 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc26 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc27.

This year I\u2019m focusing more on my health and so I thought I\u2019d share with you one of my favorite products. A probiotic is something I have spent a lot of time on choosing because of the benefits it gives me - when I found @ritual Synbiotic + I was drawn to the fact that it is so much more than just a probiotic, it is a prebiotic, probiotic and postbiotic all in one. Ritual\u2019s Synbiotic+ is backed by clinical research and a gut model study which just makes me trust the product even more.

I went to show one of the children how to use it - he is 2 - and he very quickly and strongly said \u201cI do it!\u201d His father looked at me apologetically and said \u201che really wants to do everything himself.\u201d I quickly said \u201cthat\u2019s really great, definitely frustrating, but great that he tells you and me what he wants!\u201d\n\nWhen Nell and Tess feel comfortable saying things like that, I remind myself how incredible it is. How supporting them appropriately with the process of speaking up for their comfort, preference, opinions and themselves is something that I want to preserve and protect even if it frustrates the hell out of me. It\u2019s hard to remember every single time his son continues to speak up in that little \u201cNO ME!\u201d OR \u201cI DO IT!\u201d voice to appreciate it amidst the impossible frustration of it. (And this father was very patient I just imagine after the last two weeks I had, that it\u2019s hard when it\u2019s all. day. long.)\n\nBut there is always a way to help our child know and believe \u201cI should always speak up, I should always ask, I should always say what I want to say.\u201d \n\nWhen our child screams \u201cNO STOP I WANT TO DO IT!\u201d \n\nInstead of \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me like that!\u201d we can say \u201cYou really want to do this yourself! I hear you! I am going to help you so that we can get out the door on time and we can do it together.\u201d\n\nI could give examples forever, its nuanced, I can\u2019t tell you how our children will respond each time, the goal is to not fixate on \u201casking nicely\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t\u2019 talk back\u201d because when that\u2019s the focus, our child learns that asserting themselves and speaking up is not allowed instead of believing that it\u2019s allowed and is the start of learning how to do so appropriately as they grow up. \n\nAnd when we forget to support them in those moments and we \u201close it\u201d or yell, we must point that out as the \u201cnon norm\u201d even when it\u2019s happening so much we\u2019re almost reminding ourselves at the same time. \u2063\u2063\n\nBecause otherwise, there comes a day when our children stop pushing back, because we\u2019ve spent enough time extinguishing that outspoken voice. #Letthemtalkback", "total_engagement": 978,

I took Nell to get dressed and when I got back into the living room I looked over and saw Tess scribbling on a paper that I thought was Nell\u2019s drawing. \n\nSo I asked:\n\n\u201cTess, whose drawing is that?\u201d\n\nShe said \u201cNobody\u2019s. It was no one\u2019s.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later I hear Nell yell \u201cTESSIE RUINED MY PICTURE!\u201d\n\nI was so angry inside. I looked over at Tess, walked over, kneeled down and said:\n\n\u201cYou did two things that were very wrong. Do you know what they were?\u201d\n\nShe made the face that she makes when she\u2019s trying to be stoic and hold in emotions. \n\n\u201cNo\u201d\n\nI said \u201cyou drew on Nellie\u2019s picture and then you lied to me about it. You never have to be scared if you make a mistake or do something wrong, you should always tell me the truth.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the conversation doesn\u2019t need to be written here word for word but here\u2019s what was important. \n\nWhen I said: \u201cTess, I really wonder what made you draw on her picture. What were you feeling inside? Why do you think you did that?\u201d\n\nShe kept saying she didn\u2019t know, shrugging and from the naked eye it would seem almost as if she didn\u2019t care and was straight up rude. But I knew better. I knew that she was just completely closed off because she was holding it all in. \n\nSo I said:\n\n\u201cTess you can cry.\u201d\n\nShe exploded. It all came out. She kept yelling that she didn\u2019t know why she did it and I said \u201cthat\u2019s ok! You don\u2019t need to always know.\u201d\n\nI held her for a few minutes crying and then she stopped and Nellie came in and I waited for Tess to apologize. She didn\u2019t. We ate breakfast, the girls acted normally. I almost forgot the whole thing when about 30 minutes later I saw Tess come up to Nell and whisper something. Nell looked at her and smiled. Tess then said in a soft voice \u201cdid you hear what I said Nellie? I said I was sorry.\u201d \n\nHow did we get here?

They see that their emotions are not scary and don\u2019t sway us as being our child\u2019s leader. \n3.

So simple. When it comes to things like snacks, bedtime, playtime, playground, bath, etc. this can really help kick start actually setting boundaries by switching a habit or dynamic where you really haven\u2019t.\u2063\n\u2063\nThe hardest part about boundaries with this is that our child is desiring something they \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude3a \ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude25, but also having a hard time moving on from something too. So using a visual tool where there is something that can come with them (a photo of the desired thing - playground, snack, friend) can really help.

journal entry from the week. The teachers send out journal entries emailing us about wonderful things our kids do, it\u2019s so thoughtful with photos and documentation. It\u2019s one of the reasons I chose this nursery school. I realized I hadn\u2019t even looked in weeks. Then I remembered how I used to look religiously during Tess\u2019s first year\u2026.Then I went down the spiral.\n\nI was going to start this caption listing the things I used to do that seem to have fallen off my parenting radar. I started with how I barely cook, I barely read books to them at night, and then I stopped. It wasn\u2019t productive or rational to pine for mom behaviors of mine that are no longer - especially because I think those behaviors have been filled with even more valuable ones. My children who once were, are now the children that they\u2019ve become. We have all changed and grown together. \n\nThe rest of this caption is a sentiment I have shared before that is worth sharing over and over. \n\nWe\u2019ll sometimes miss the parent we were. Think we should be the parent we were. Feel guilty that we\u2019re not the parent that we once were. \n\nWe compare ourselves to other moms, but even harder, we compare ourselves to the other mom versions of ourselves. \n\nI\u2019m just not the same mom I was to my first daughter that I am to my two daughters. \n\nBut then I remember this conversation I had with 2 of my mom friends.\n\nI said \u201cIt\u2019s funny because if our second child was a better eater, we would think it was because we didn\u2019t get as caught up but if they were a worse eater we\u2019d say it was because we didn\u2019t get to focus as much as we did on our first child.\u201d\n\nMeaning that our child could get the same amount of attention in this area of development and it could go either way, but we\u2019d still think that whatever way it went was a reflection of us. \n\nI cooked from scratch and ate every meal with my first born, Tess. She was a terrible eater. I barely had time to eat with Nell, she was a better eater. Now? I\u2019m tempted to say there are both good and bad eaters but then I realize - aren\u2019t we all?

Until they can really sort through that, they can\u2019t genuinely imagine how others feel. Both are developing at the same time but we often focus so much on how our children impact others with little focus on how they\u2019re grappling with their own feelings simultaneously. \n\nSometimes I do this exercise after a rough experience with my girls, where I imagine what my children may have been going through in their mind.

It was a total of 45 minutes but in those 45 minutes I wasn\u2019t making any micro decisions (besides my lip color, thank you @svenja.ostwald !).

I added the soap and wash component which may have been their favorite part. \n\nI actually think it was better for the four hour car ride to get this energy out.

Our other child feels confused about this change. Even if they are showing affection towards their sibling, inside they are grappling with \u201cIs my parent still my parent if they are also the parent to this new baby?\u201d\n\nThen the infant starts to crawl one day. What was once a sibling who just stayed in a bassinet, crib, in grown ups arms, and spent time on a floor in one place, now becomes more of a mobile being getting into our other child\u2019s belongings, distracting parents with their mobility. This is when we may see more regressions in our older children. It\u2019s a new birth. \n\nThen this crawling child starts to take steps. The whole family cheers and celebrates. Our older children now truly see their sibling as an actual human being. This comes with a whole wave of threats and emotions too. \n\nAll this to say, there are many births, transitions, acceptances that our children go through when it comes to siblings. It continues throughout life not just at birth. It\u2019s our job to be attuned to this and to talk about the changes that come with new milestones and developments.\n\nNotice your older child during these new milestones your infant is accomplishing.\n\nSome things we can say:\n\n\u201cWow, doesn\u2019t it feel different now that your sister is crawling?! We put her down in one spot and then she\u2019s across the room! How does that feel for you?\u201d\n\nAnd reassuring them with one important reminder:\n\n\u201cYou know that I am always your parent and love you very much.

Take a deep breath, realize that this will take a lot shorter amount of time if we give our child what they need, and get ready to hunker down, for just a little longer. \u2063\n\u2063\nI used to say to Tess \u201cIt sounds like you don\u2019t want to go to bed yet, huh? Should we read an extra book?\u201d I just mentally tell myself to slow down and incorporate connecting moments. \u2063Here\u2019s a glimpse of the reality of that and how even though I preach this, I sometimes try to take short cuts too \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f #wereallhuman", "total_engagement": 810, "engagement_rate": 0.008128857443925937, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-24T01:35:01.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "parent", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "child", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "list", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "children", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "toddler", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "no one", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nights", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reasons", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "pages", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bedtime", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "no one", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "consultants", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "wereallhuman"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132068057590, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:09.057Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:09.057Z"}, {"id": 607775132068057588, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "906644724", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:09.050Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:09.050Z"}, {"id": 607775132203564664, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:45.648Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:27.039Z"}, {"id": 607775132203564667, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:45.657Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:27.049Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175172345774, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CpJO7L2Lqyb/", "post_id": "3047032262713322651", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/d73630e0fc08a61726c954cdd8602266.JPEG", "phash": "bb9783783178c24d", "image_entities": [{"entity": "love", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8607573509216309}, {"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5979305505752563}, {"entity": "dating", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4791489243507385}, {"entity": "kissing", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.36263543367385864}, {"entity": "make out", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.33097726106643677}, {"entity": "sky", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24471062421798706}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24163442850112915}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8061073422431946}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7595381140708923}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6668388247489929}, {"entity": "balloon", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.31731978058815}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2784942090511322}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20602843165397644}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-06T15:35:57.189Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-07T10:59:18.308Z"}}], "post_text": "Sometimes we get so used to correcting our children that we do it without even thinking.\n\nSometimes we don\u2019t know what else to do or say to our children without reflexively correcting.\n\nI made this reel for this purpose and couldn\u2019t keep a straight face because it felt so inauthentic to respond to my child with a correction when she was telling me she bumped her head.

This morning, I got to see the girls for the first time in 24 hrs but knew I had to bye again for the day. Nell had nature day at school in the park so she needed to be dressed super warm. I planned for her to wear this new gloriously soft sweater jacket as an extra layer. This sweater is literally a dream, like Nell would have had a hug all day at the park if she had this layer. Basically alll my mom guilt was wrapped into this sweater. \n\nI could not find it. I couldn\u2019t let it go. I couldn\u2019t leave without looking in \u201cone more place.\u201d\n\nUntil I finally had to let it go to get them to school on time. It was hard to do honestly. Tess had hers on but my Nellie didn\u2019t. No one would have understood this need for Nell\u2019s sweater. You may not even understand it reading it. \n\nI do know what you would understand -  when you\u2019re feeling off, and you have to drag yourself to a dinner and you want to wear your favorite pair of jeans. But you can\u2019t find them. \n\nThat\u2019s what our children feel each time they fixate on something seemingly small. When they can\u2019t leave the house on time. When they can\u2019t get dressed. When their pancake isn\u2019t the right size. It\u2019s the case of the missing jeans. Something feels very necessary and real and urgent about it even if no one understands why. \n\nI have had 39 years to grapple with this feeling and I can tell you that if anyone said to me this morning \u201ccome on we have to go, it\u2019s not a big deal\u201d I would have wanted to cry lol. What I would have wanted was someone to come over and say \u201cI\u2019m not sure why you want this sweater so badly but I see  that something about it feels very important to you. Even if we can\u2019t find it, I want you to know I will help you look when we have more time. I\u2019m here to give you a hug if you want it.\u201d\n\nBefore you approach your child with the belief that they\u2019re being \u201csilly\u201d or \u201cdramatic,\u201d try to connect with them instead, and tell yourself:\n\n\u201cThis is a big deal to my child, even if I don\u2019t understand why.\u201d", "total_engagement": 631, "engagement_rate": 0.0063324803050830445, "network_type":

But what about helping our child with these things preemptively. Modeling that they happen to all of us in between them happening to them. \n\nOur children look to us as their compass in life.

When our children don\u2019t do what we say that does not equate that they \u201caren\u2019t listening.\u201d \n\nWays to rethink \u201cnot listening\u201d include:\n\nTalk about what it means to \u201clisten.\u201d Both to your child and to yourself and other caregivers. Listening is hearing, not following orders. \n\nevery time you reflexively think \u201cmy child isn\u2019t listening\u201d remember that you\u2019re really saying \u201cmy child isn\u2019t obeying\u201d and it will force you to reapproach the situation more productively. \n\nStart to adjust your responses when your child is having a hard time cooperating, see your child and tell them you see them \u201cyou really want to keep watching tv, i can see that, you have 2 more minutes and then i\u2019m going to turn it off\u201d instead of \u201ccome to bed, no more tv\u201d and then saying our child \u201cisnt\u2019 listening\u201d when they don\u2019t just obey that task. \n\nThink about what it takes to get on the same page with any human when there is a consistent challenge in a relationship - it takes connection and problem solving. When something isn\u2019t working (your child consistently has a hard time cooperating in the morning or before bedtime) change the routine and include your child. Diffuse the prior wiring that your child had. I imagine my child is subconsciously thinking something like \u201cI wake up, this is when mommy orders me to do things and I don\u2019t want to do them because I\u2019m nervous for school and this is when I assert myself and don\u2019t cooperate\u201d and then I think of how that can be replaced with something like: \u201cMommy and I made a new routine plan last night, I\u2019m gonna wake up and do it with her!

There are a variety of reasons why children may seem like they are yelling at us but I want to reframe and believe that these children are yelling for us. For us to hear them, see them, and more than anything, help them. These children need help.\u00a0\n\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\nWe can help a child learn how to respect people and to learn not to yell without reflexively responding \u201cask nicely\u201d which can often further dysregulation. We can set boundaries around tone in a way that still connects us to children. \u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\u2063\u2063\nWhat if a 3 yr old came up to you at a party and said \u201cI am nervous in this new place with all of these people and want to feel connected to you.

I must be feeling something I shouldn\u2019t feel, I must be bad.

I finally did yesterday and it helped immensely.\n\nBecause just saying \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to be scared of!\u201d really doesn\u2019t help a child with their fear. It can create more fear because they feel even more alone and disconnected. Sort of \u201cno one understands\u201d feeling. Instead, we can go through scenarios and join them in their fear. Validate and connect. We want to help them access and explore what\u2019s happening inside but then we also want to help prepare them for those feelings when they happen in the future. \n\nI learned that Nell\u2019s fear comes from the feeling she gets when water goes up her nose. She expressed it with \u201cit makes me feel sick.\u201d So we prepared her for what she can do when she goes under water to avoid this feeling, we empowered her to blow out of her nose and hold her breath.\n\nExperience helps to lessen fear. If we can prepare our child for what it may feel like to be in their feared experience but equip them with tools when in that experience - that feels more empowering to me than basically saying \u201cdon\u2019t be silly - there\u2019s nothing to fear\u201d which I imagine probably adds some version of \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with me\u201d in the moment of the actual fear.\n\nMy goal when my child is scared of something is to help them access \u201cOk I went through this before!\u201d or \u201cok I talked about this feeling with mommy and I have a tool!\u201d \n\nRemember this: If a child is afraid, then there is something to be afraid of.

She saw her two close friends leaving together for a playdate. \n\nIt brought up so much in my heart. One of the first memories I have of social challenges is when my two best friends would \u201cleave me out\u201d as a kid. It was three of us, I was part of the leaving out too, but when I was the odd one out, gosh it sucked. \n\nSo when I saw Tess stare off I wanted to take her heart, pump it up with a magic juice that made her think \u201cThat looks fun! I\u2019m going to go home now with my mom but good for them!\u201d but how do we do that? \n\nI knew asking her directly how she felt would have made her shut down. So I took her with me on an afternoon fill of errands (you don\u2019t need to do this, but the rest is something that matters more) As the situation felt \u201cless fresh\u201d I said \u201cTess I want to tell you a story\u201d and I told her how my friends had a sleepover one night without me when I was younger and asked her how she thought that felt for me. \n\nTogether we answered some questions that I knew would help her. She reflected on it with me and we figured out that it didn\u2019t mean my friends didn\u2019t love me, it didn\u2019t mean anything was wrong with me, and that sometimes were part of play dates and parties and sometimes we aren\u2019t.\n\nHere\u2019s my takeaways:\nTell your children if you\u2019ve felt what they are feeling in a given moment, not to make the experience about you but to help your child process feelings that are really hard to grapple with. To normalize them. The moment we normalize them, the moment our children start facing them and coming to terms with them. The moment they begin to grow from them. \n\nHelp your child to support themselves in tough situations. Give them questions they can ask and answer themselves \u201cdoes this mean something is wrong with me? No! Does this mean they don\u2019t love me? No!\u201d\n\nPeople matter - when our child feels a lack of connection somewhere - fill them with a connection but a human one.

It can feel really new, different, cold, hard, grueling and uncomfortable at times but then you get through that tunnel of the hard stuff, the hard stuff doesn\u2019t feel so hard, uncomfortable or scary anymore. \n\nBelieve it or not, once you allow the tunnel it turns out being a lot shorter long term, than trying to avoid it all together. I\u2019ll share more in stories how this helped us so much with everything so far - As Tess said \u201cbecause there\u2019s always a light at the end of a tunnel but you have to go through the tunnel to get there right Mama?\u201d\n\n#theresalwaysalightattheend", "total_engagement": 340, "engagement_rate": 0.0034121130011540973, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-21T23:35:09.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "tool", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "page", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "messages", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "children", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "much", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "times", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "game changer", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tunnel", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mindset", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "feeling", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "feelings", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "theresalwaysalightattheend"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132068058142, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:11.346Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:11.346Z"}, {"id": 607775132068058141, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-2084919050", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:11.343Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:11.343Z"}, {"id": 607775132203564835, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:46.359Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:27.553Z"}, {"id": 607775132203564836, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:46.367Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:27.558Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175187605837, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CqJuNrbsr7r/", "post_id": "3065184271530639083", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/dea5a79562849c947e88d3f5ffe795d5.JPEG", "phash": "bb90833a137cb3c5", "image_entities": [{"entity": "community", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.853891134262085}, {"entity": "crowd", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.42879822850227356}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.37655875086784363}, {"entity": "product", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3572257161140442}, {"entity": "sky", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.33767473697662354}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2845190465450287}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8694797158241272}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8565686345100403}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6679580807685852}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6612654328346252}, {"entity": "soccer ball", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.26219579577445984}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-06T15:11:33.600Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-07T11:01:09.514Z"}}], "post_text": "The clothes, the cold, the physical experience, the coordination, the logistics, the pep talks, the preparation, the travel, to get to this moment, the list is endless\u2026\n\nI\u2019m crying while taking this video. It\u2019s one of the moments I had imagined having with my kids one day and here it was happening and it was even better than I had imagined it would be. Not because I care about her skill as a skier or her skill in anything, but I care about experiencing life with her in the way feels right to her. \n\nI care that to get to this moment, it took SO much and that SHE got there. Not because I had a vision and wanted her to live it out but because along the way, every step of the way, it was what she wanted to do. Because of how thoughtfully Matt and I approached this experience - years in the making. Always encouraging our girls to try hard things, and to focus on the hard work, how it all feels, and not the end result of things. \n\nTo get to any point in parenting where you are on the same page as another human being, is very hard work. I can tell you that skiing is just a metaphor for so much more. If one parent is parenting with respect for their child, preparing them, approaching hard experiences thoughtfully and checking in with their child - it matters if the other caregiver or parent is complaining along the way, bringing negative energy, saying \u201cit\u2019s too much\u201d or being too pushy with their child, (or a million other examples). \n\nMatt and I didn\u2019t agree on her skiing with us today. He thought she\u2019d be too tired and I thought she would want to. We didn\u2019t agree but we didn\u2019t bring that energy to pick her up.

views. But with time and a lot of \u201cwow this works\u201d moments, it is possible to get on the same page. Not thru incessant nitpicking or calling eachother out in real time, but seeing how children respond in their toughest moments, even when our responses take longer than quick fixes. For us, putting in that effort to overcome our reflexive frustrations, to take the time to connect and figure out what\u2019s underneath the behavior, has helped us \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25. 2 pieces of advice:\u2063 1. Be proactive instead of reactive. Build in time. We plan date nights right? Or we should. Bc unplugging and focusing entirely on another person is what life is about. Kids react to us, when we\u2019re distracted and stressed, they feel disconnected and insecure. If you build in time for children to connect to their caregivers instead of muscling thru the whining, you help your child find grounding instead of experiencing them being clingy and feeling disconnected all day. It gives us perspective, instead of reacting to tantrums with frustration, you and your spouse start to do this emotional check in \u201chmmmm we \ud835\ude29\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude37\ud835\ude26 been super busy.\u201d Make it a priority to be proactive \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude27\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26 everyone is running on empty. 2. You want everyone to be real: not for them to feel nervous, unsure or as if they can\u2019t do anything right. Everyone should really believe in the approach they are taking. Kids can feel and see right through when our words don\u2019t match our bodies. So when a partner is taking on your way of speaking to your child just to appease you, it may not be effective for anyone. They need to find their own way and we need to accept and be ok with that. We plant seeds but we can\u2019t control the sun, water, and growth right? When I say that responsive parenting is contagious, I mean it with every fiber of my body - \ud835\ude23\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2c\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude34 \ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2e\ud835\ude26.  Lastly, this type of parenting helps you to stop feeling like you\u2019re grasping at straws, putting out fires, nervous for the next tantrum - bc you feel prepared. Everyone needs someone who understands them. \ud835\uddea\ud835\udc1e are those people for our children. If we don\u2019t take the time to try to understand them, who will??\u2063", "total_engagement": 252, "engagement_rate": 0.0025289778714436247, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at":

It may seem minimal but it means my girls think that 8 pm is 6 pm and that they could easily end up going to bed at 10 pm EST if I don\u2019t fix this immediately. \n\nSo I got home before they got back from a play date and thought of how I could get them to bed STAT. I started making their favorite turkey sliders - which requires a cut onion. I hate the smell of onion on my hands and teary eyes so I put on my gloves and sunglasses and took on a whole alter ego (maybe it means I need to spend more time in the kitchen \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)\n\nBut all jokes aside - having dinner earlier and ready for overtired kids is a game changer. Otherwise they get home, they\u2019re wired, they want to play and avoid any semblance of eating. Then they avoid every single bedtime step after that until suddenly they\u2019re so over exhausted that they believe they want dinner and it\u2019s now 8 p.m. \n\nI believe you have a literal 5 minute window to fit in dinner when you have exhausted children at the helm.\n\nTransitioning them from coming in the door directly to the table ready with food is one thing, but having a smaller amount of food is always more helpful for my girls who get overwhelmed by overflowing plates of food. I use these animal and car picks because it makes the meal more fun. \n\nYou may think that some of this seems overwhelming or as if I\u2019m an over achieving parent but I assure you none of this was hard, I used microwavable pre cut broccoli - proudly. \n\nI also promise that I did all of this for me. I\u2019m exhausted and it\u2019s only been 24 hours since our family \u201cvacation.\u201d \n\nSo this post is for any of you who feel guilty that bedtime can\u2019t come soon enough. Just put on sunglasses and get lost in your mission. If I can do it, you can do it. \n\nProud to say I can write this post all by 7 pm because the girls are fast asleep. \ud83d\ude09 \ud83d\ude09", "total_engagement": 373, "engagement_rate": 0.003743288674795524, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-27T23:17:36.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "parent", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "dinner", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "colorado", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "kitchen", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "girls", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "anything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132068058287, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:11.899Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:11.899Z"}, {"id": 607775132068058284, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-60152674", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:11.896Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:11.896Z"}, {"id": 607775132203564871, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:46.481Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:27.667Z"}, {"id": 607775132203564875, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:46.486Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:27.673Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175187605833, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CqY_PQhOzR9/", "post_id": "3069481271512740989", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/e5f51cd854fd14eadddd18db20cef7fb.JPEG", "phash": "e0ebc9976c150ef0", "image_entities": [{"entity": "baking", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8892240524291992}, {"entity": "cake", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5835563540458679}, {"entity": "child", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4179398715496063}, {"entity": "cupcake", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4050408899784088}, {"entity": "dessert", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4040054976940155}, {"entity": "food", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.40038561820983887}, {"entity": "icing", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3772246539592743}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.36554110050201416}, {"entity": "sweetness", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.27756813168525696}, {"entity": "muffin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20708145201206207}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7115285992622375}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6100060343742371}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.41794729232788086}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3307403028011322}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.29358527064323425}, {"entity": "cake", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2815415561199188}, {"entity": "baked goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2517179250717163}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24249666929244995}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21309775114059448}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-06T13:43:17.020Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-07T11:00:32.796Z"}}], "post_text": "Do you want to know what is the strongest factor in how a child grows up to see themselves?\u2063\n\u2063\nHow \ud835\udc30\ud835\udc1e react to them.

You don\u2019t need to always jump into the fire if you know it\u2019s there. I mean, yes you do if it\u2019s just you, but when and if it doesn\u2019t always have to be, take the few minutes. Hide in your room. Wait in the lobby. Sit in your car. Do. Not. Feel. Guilty. \u2063\n\u2063\nSo often we are made to feel guilty for needing space. That there\u2019s something wrong with us if we decide to take space for ourselves.\n\u2063\nI actually think it is the best lesson we can embody - thinking ahead of who we \ud835\ude38\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35 to be and not walking into just becoming the people we \ud835\ude25\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\u2019\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude38\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude35 to be. If I walked into my apartment today and didn\u2019t take the time to hide, sit and just be, I know I would not have shown up as the mom or person I would want to be. \u2063\n\u2063\nInstead of feeling guilty about this, I actually feel proud, I don\u2019t think you can get more self aware than being aware of who you will be before you are even that person. That\u2019s what I call healing and growing. \u2063\n\nNothing is wrong with needing space and more people should take it, the world would be so much of a better place. #hidefromyourkids #sometimes",

\u201cexperiencing,\u201d trusting that with every \u201cquit\u201d comes learning. Sometimes it\u2019s the right decision and sometimes it isn\u2019t. Don\u2019t be afraid for you or your child to make the wrong decision.

We support their growing ability to trust themselves by trusting them too.\u2063\u2063\u2063\n\u2022 Figure out the why - help your child to figure out what\u2019s really not enjoyable about the activity. We do this by asking questions - bringing them to the experience in their minds to see what it brings up. \u2063\u2063\u2063\n\u2022 Is it a habit? Are they giving up on many things? Or did they give something a fair shot?\u2063\u2063\u2063\n\u2022 Are they always fearful of new things? If so, talk about how trying something new is a tunnel to work through - come up with a timeline together for how long it may take to get through that tunnel.\u2063\u2063\u2063\n\u2022 Talk about what it means to stop an activity. Sometimes a child isn\u2019t thinking about what that really means. Maybe they just want to adjust something about the activity.\u2063\u2063\u2063\n \u2022 \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b

reality of instilling in them the utmost respect for themselves and their bodies even in the face of potential commentary, teasing, or, god forbid, attempts at harrassment in their future. This actually goes for any gender but based on my own experience as a young girl and woman, I personally feel strongly about it because I\u2019m raising girls. \n\nThe other day we were in the jacuzzi and Tess yanked down my bathing suit top. Similar to what you see in this video. She then said something like \u201cyour boobies are so small mommy!\u201d \n\nI laughed, at first. But then I quickly realized this was an opportunity for something important. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t like that. This is my body and I don\u2019t want you pulling down my bathing suit. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d Then I said \u201cYou know when I was younger in school, people used to tease me about my boobies.\u201d I said, \u201cbut i\u2019m telling you this because no one is allowed to touch or talk about your body in a way that you don\u2019t like.

What I meant by this is that we often think that if our children come to us with a conflict (most often between siblings) that we are required to solve it for them. We can respond in one of two general ways:\n\nHear the conflict and \u201ccall\u201d it. \nHear the conflict and empower them to work through it. \n\nThe latter is what will help everyone long term but the former is what feels necessary. Very rarely will the former not result in protests from one of the siblings and/or its only a matter of time before it does again. You are constantly at your child\u2019s beck and call to solve challenges for them, to be the one to say \u201che had it first, give it back\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t do that, say sorry\u201d or even worse, you\u2019re required to be your children\u2019s timer and constantly required to resolve things for them. \n\nThis does little to help them with conflicts in their life socially. Even at school, my hope is that educators help to educate our children on how to problem solve through conflicts (that are appropriate) instead of doing that for them. In this reel I show the difference between being a \u201creferee\u201d and being a listener. Sometimes that\u2019s all that children want, someone to hear, see, and validate them to help fuel them up to solve the issue on their own. Other times children need our help not to solve, but to process what happens. \n\nIt\u2019s not about leaving your children high and dry to fend for themselves, it\u2019s about the fact that children learn to respect one another more when they directly interact. The long term goal is to help siblings feel \u201cWe can work through this!\u201d instead of immediately thinking \u201cwe can\u2019t handle this without mommy.\u201d \n\nThere are a few things you can say instead of \u201ccalling it\u201d or \u201ctaking a side\u201d that can empower your children to solve these frequent challenges on their own. \n\n\u201cHmmm how did that feel?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you let her know that?\u201d \n\n\u201cThat sounds like a tough situation!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think would feel good to everyone?\u201d\n\nWe may still have to step in, but we rarely need to initially.", "total_engagement": 439, "engagement_rate": 0.004405640022078378, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-09T23:15:05.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "pieces", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "conflict", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "siblings", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "educators", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "children", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "stories", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "referee", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "role", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "advice", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132068058548, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:12.882Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:12.882Z"}, {"id": 607775132068058546, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1211659932", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:12.879Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:12.879Z"}, {"id": 607775132203564975, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:46.784Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:27.932Z"}, {"id": 607775132203564977, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:46.791Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:27.939Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175195532085, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq6etjfuW5u/", "post_id": "3078908367146151534", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/778e9a7870998de00dc34f0bbeadd880.JPEG", "phash": "e91cd1e817a5bbc0", "image_entities": [{"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6542180776596069}, {"entity": "eyewear", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5929158329963684}, {"entity": "fashion", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5084019303321838}, {"entity": "pink", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.361093670129776}, {"entity": "street fashion", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3400932848453522}, {"entity": "sunglasses", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2575215697288513}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9824344515800476}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9733610153198242}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9538348913192749}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9471539258956909}, {"entity": "sunglasses", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7830541133880615}, {"entity": "car", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7514389157295227}, {"entity": "car", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5511550903320312}, {"entity": "car", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4960384666919708}, {"entity": "wheel", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.43448811769485474}, {"entity": "bag", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3683842122554779}, {"entity": "tire", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22975270450115204}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-19T22:44:51.627Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-07T11:01:53.780Z"}}], "post_text": "I picked Nell up from school and had an hour and 15 minutes before I had to pick up Tess.

I said hold it just a few min and we\u2019ll use the potty right when we get to our building. As we walked back to our building we bumped into someone we knew who was like \u201cyou need a photo of this!\u201d so we stopped for a photo. We got to our building with not a moment to spare and rushed Nell to the potty. Nell started resisting and protesting. \n\nHow do I respectfully parent one child when my other child will walk out of school to no one there. Don\u2019t I owe Tess respect too? What does one do???\n\nI lost it. I said \u201cyou have to pee pee right now!\u201d She lost it then too. We made it in time but on the way I apologized to Nell. For a moment I thought, \u201cjust like we always say there\u2019s emotions behind our children\u2019s behavior, shouldn\u2019t they know there are emotions behind ours?\u201d The answer is yes but that \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\u2019\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1d\u2019\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2d. \n\nHere\u2019s why - Nell is not responsible for the fact that I could have had her use the bathroom before the grocery store, or that I shouldn\u2019t have stopped for the photo or that I should have left us more time. That\u2019s my responsibility. I was the one who left it to the millisecond in which it became about Nell using the potty in order to get to Tess in time. That\u2019s on me. \n\nSo that\u2019s what I said. I said \u201cjust like you have feelings and you sometimes do things you wish you didn\u2019t do, I do too. I wish I didn\u2019t yell at you to use the potty. I should have left us more time. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \n\nDo you see how this scenario isn\u2019t about Nell obeying using the potty in a rushed way in order to get to Tess in time?

Just the thought of keeping our nerves at bay when it comes to all of this coupled with babies and children is enough to feel not calm without even interacting directly.\n\nBut let me tell you, when we can find our calm in the face of things that used to automatically evoke immediate stress, we are doing something huge for our children. We are expressing trust. Trust not only in our children (that empowers them to trust themselves) but trust in ourselves and our ability to get through any day of parenting (and there are many of them). \n\nI could go on and on about how our mentality and attitude is contagious for our children one way or the other.

Children aren\u2019t born with tools. We weren\u2019t born with them either. When you see a child unable to regulate, they are lacking tools. When you see a child who is growing up continuously unable to regulate, this child\u2019s caregivers may be lacking tools to give them (or this child may have specific challenges that continuously make it harder to learn regulation skills). I still don\u2019t believe they\u2019re bad.\n\nThis is why I see no reason for yelling at or shaming a child. When we are modeling our inability to regulate (yelling and shaming) how do we possibly expect our children to learn how to regulate?\n\nWe\u2019re all human and it sometimes happens but children who are the \u201cmost difficult\u201d need the most tools. Children who look at you and laugh as they are seemingly \u201cpurposely\u201d not listening, are in the need of the most connection. Their laughter is nervousness and awkwardness in how to ask for it. \n\nToday we were at brunch and I saw that the louder I got, the louder my girls got. The more dysregulated I got, the more dysregulated they got. The more I was focused elsewhere, the more they ignored me when I asked them to \u201cplease listen.\u201d\n\nNo matter what you believe - just know that when you believe there are \u201cno bad kids\u201d you will see that your children become \u201ceasier\u201d because you are finally understanding what they need. \n\nExamples of self regulation: taking deep breaths, remembering this reel before responding, closing your eyes and counting to ten, remembering you have an opportunity to model how to handle \u201chard times.\u201d\n\nExamples of empathy: Remind yourself: \u201cThere is always an emotion behind a behavior\u201d or \u201cmy child is good and is just having a hard time\u201d or \u201cI am a good parent having a hard time.\u201d\n\nExamples of connection: Humor, a game, saying \u201cit seems like it\u2019s time for us to just be together\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m here\u201d and trusting that you are modeling not enabling. Trust that this exact moment of your child\u2019s dysregulation is not a learning moment.", "total_engagement": 819, "engagement_rate": 0.00821917808219178, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-24T00:27:57.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132068058899, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:14.561Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:14.561Z"}, {"id": 607775132068058897, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "219332331", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:14.558Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:14.558Z"}, {"id": 607775132203565096, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:47.165Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:28.199Z"}, {"id": 607775132203565100, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:47.172Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:28.208Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175200485081, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CrekHdmu-Di/", "post_id": "3089065236921835746", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/bc57c47df8a0b19cc6a950d229eec7a9.JPEG", "phash": "fbf29b180a2b0b35", "image_entities": [{"entity": "cheek", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9865880608558655}, {"entity": "child", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9772564172744751}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9044675230979919}, {"entity": "facial expression", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8102745413780212}, {"entity": "fun", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7631935477256775}, {"entity": "happy", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6993185877799988}, {"entity": "teeth", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5403799414634705}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.45889800786972046}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4459863007068634}, {"entity": "mouth", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.40594592690467834}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3956107199192047}, {"entity": "tongue", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3015303909778595}, {"entity": "organ", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22800245881080627}, {"entity": "tooth", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2273353785276413}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22329078614711761}, {"entity": "smile", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2082398682832718}, {"entity": "balloon", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.34410348534584045}, {"entity": "tie", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.300085186958313}, {"entity": "balloon", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22688846290111542}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-05-07T16:45:51.299Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-07T11:02:27.607Z"}}], "post_text": "There\u2019s a reason they say that \u201cold habits die hard.\u201d There\u2019s also a reason we allow \u201cbad\u201d habits and then a reason we avoid breaking them. \u2063\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\u2063\nWe lack trust.

I know that bringing an object to the bathroom can help, but not when they want to bring in their entire playroom (boundaries!).

Showing them \u201cI got you\u201d through this simple parental act that they grew up accustomed to. \u2063\n\u2063\nWhen our children are born, we spend time supporting them with things like eating and sleeping. We usually rush both processes and celebrate the days they can do things independently. Then, before they know it, we have taken away a large source of how we showed our care and love (through things like feeding and sleeping). Each time our child yearns for or needs the reminder of this love through care we are inclined to say: \u2063\n\u201cyou know how to do it by yourself!\u201d\u2063\n\u2063\nI don\u2019t suggest that we perpetually feed and sleep with our children. I post this to say that we cannot let our fixation on raising \u201cindependent children,\u201d get in the way of feeding our children sometimes - figuratively and literally. Even if and when they can feed themselves.\u2063\n\u2063\nHere\u2019s why: everyone needs to be taken care of. Everyone deserves care. Even the most independent, \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201ctough\u201d people. (you know that scene in the Sex and the City movie when Samantha feeds Carrie in bed after her world has been turned upside down? I cry every time I see that scene.) When we fixate on \u201cdo it yourself\u201d or \u201cyou know how to, you\u2019re a big girl\u201d when our children are in need of support, we send a message that they shouldn\u2019t need us sometimes. Sometimes, in a child\u2019s village, a child\u2019s source of believing in unconditional love is being able to experience the love their caregiver gave them for the majority of their young life - even when they know how to independently. \u2063\n\u2063\nDon\u2019t associate that \ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude22 \ud835\ude38\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26 with lack of independence. Don\u2019t bring the fear of \u201cbad habits\u201d into the equation.

Sometimes it\u2019s barely a touch other times it\u2019s an accidental harder brush against her. Yet each time she has the same reaction. She\u2019s really upset. \n\nI\u2019m aware enough to know that this isn\u2019t about how hard or soft the bag or something bumps into her. It\u2019s about the frustration around it. How small she is made to feel during these moments of \u201cI don\u2019t even see you!\u201d and then the \u201cI barely touched you!\u201d that\u2019s typically  the reflexive response. \n\nYet there is not one morsel of my body that ever wants to respond with \u201cbut I barely touched you!\u201d or \u201cNell, it was just a tap of my sweater!\u201d Why would I? To teach her what is a big deal and what isn\u2019t? Tell her what should annoy or frustrate her and what shouldn\u2019t?\n\nIt\u2019s like we think unless it\u2019s painful and a big smack or big deal to us, then our child shouldn\u2019t be bothered? Who are we to tell our children that they shouldn\u2019t trust their own emotions by demeaning whether or not something is a \u201cbig enough deal\u201d to us? \n\nI know that it can feel like the most frustrating thing ever when I get nudged on a subway or pushed past. I also know that my level of frustration probably depends more on what kind of day I\u2019m having. I would either not be phased if I\u2019m having a good day or be really annoyed if it was a bad day.\n\nBut I\u2019ll tell you this, no matter what my reaction, having someone turn around and say \u201cBut I barely touched you!\u201d would just make it feel worse or as if I somehow made it up in my head?\n\nLet\u2019s not ignore things just because they seem small to us. If we don\u2019t validate or believe our child with the little stuff when they are little, why will they trust us to take them seriously with the big stuff when they\u2019re big?

Someone messaged me \u201cOh god such drama.\u201d I know that it affected me because when I get really affected, I become defensive and that was my first plan of response. But then I breathed and wrote \u201cOh I know. My deeply feeling 3 year old. Love her and all of her feelings so much.\u201d \n\nBut what I didn\u2019t write was that this particular story that she was commenting on was also one of the things I actually said in a group at an event last week was the thing I think I\u2019m succeeding at as a mom. \n\nBeing attuned to my daughters. \n\nBeing attuned is our ability to be aware of and respond to our child\u2019s needs. Not just the obvious needs but the very nuanced itty bitty ones. Each child has a different temperament and personality and on top of that, our young children can\u2019t communicate so clearly because of a few things 1. Some aren\u2019t even verbal yet. 2. They aren\u2019t even aware of some of their needs and 3. We\u2019re overwhelmed, busy, distracted and preoccupied with the 8000 open tabs in our brains. So being attuned is actually really hard. It\u2019s when we feel deeply connected to our child. When we know, without a doubt, what they\u2019re upset about when it seems no one else does. \n\nI truly want that for every parent and child. It\u2019s like this magical, spiritual connection that you have with your child that allows you to become their expert. It ebbs and flows, naturally, when we feel less connected and less attuned. But being really attuned is like a double edged sword for some of us.

ESPECIALLY the seeming \u201cdefiant\u201d ones, the \u201cnon listeners\u201d the ones who \u201cmisbehave.\u201d They often don\u2019t feel noticed for anything besides the negative. So, I\u2019ll talk about them positively. I\u2019ll usually always loop them in because it feels inauthentic not to. I\u2019d say to my co-teacher \u201cHey Ms. Li, did you see what Henry did earlier with the blocks? He built this unbelievably tall tower, focused so much on each one, and it was really cool to see!\u201d Then I\u2019d look over at Henry laser focused and smiling slightly and say \u201cHenry I saw that creation you made!\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve been doing this recently after moments that I know have been hard for Tess even if she isn\u2019t expressing it. For instance in a moment when Nell is upset it\u2019s hard for all of us not to get triggered. It\u2019s a lot. Tess used to often get angry about it, and probably still is inside, so I make sure she knows I notice. \n\nWe all want to feel special, we all want to be loved, and\nsome children need to be noticed for the \u201cgood stuff\u201d not just when they\u2019re being disciplined.\n\nSo maybe try this if you feel you have a child who is \u201cdefiant\u201d maybe all it will take it noticing them in a \u201cgood\u201d moment without directly telling them - but telling someone else they love. \n\nAudio @leaveyour_marc", "total_engagement": 19, "engagement_rate": 0.00019067690300567013,

through the emotions of accepting that soon we won\u2019t have my childhood home - I was trying to really figure out what feels so hard about it. \n\nI have spent the past few days going through a house filled with 35 years of memories, almost like this huge time capsule - and as I opened each drawer I saw the familiar \u201corganized mess\u201d in each one and I was reminded of something that is so important for us to remember. \u2063\n\nI always looked up to my mom (and still do) but I remember when I realized that other moms had organized drawers and she didn't. I remember going to one friends in particular. Her mom had everything labeled, a shelf with construction paper organized by color and every drawer with organizers. Now that I\u2019m a mom, it makes me love my mom even more that she didn\u2019t have organized drawers. Showing up for us is something she was perfect at. \n\nThe second thing I realized is that this home stands for security.  That\u2019s what feels the hardest, it\u2019s as if I feel I\u2019m going to lose this symbol of security. Something so much more powerful and important than perhaps even love. I have felt secure and safe in this home no matter when or where I have been in my life for the last 35 of my 40 years. It\u2019s a wave that has always come over me every time I\u2019ve walked through that door. But as I was writing this I realize that wave is something that doesn\u2019t depend on a physical space but on the relationships within it, far from perfect, but always secure.

The girls were just not cooperating and nothing was getting done. \u2063\n\u2063\nThis video was not planned. Matt had no idea I started recording. When he caught me recording, I just said \u201cthis is going to be helpful! Now record me!\u201d Of course my approach may seem like it would take longer, giving them a pre warning, clearing the table slowly, kissing the figurines... but it actually doesn\u2019t take longer than wrangling screaming, thrashing kids up the stairs.\u2063\n\u2063\nThis is not meant to depict that dads aren\u2019t as good at getting the kids to transition as moms are. This is meant to say that children thrive off of knowing what is going to happen ahead of time and being led by grown ups who are sure of themselves. They need confident leaders to guide them.

I knew that it was probably a rough one for Nell once I found out she hadn\u2019t napped after camp and a playdate. When I got back from NJ late I asked Matt how bad it was and he said Nell was a wreck. It\u2019s one of tne of the things that is hard for me to let go of when I can\u2019t be around. Knowing how to get my kids through situations like that - helping them feel unstuck.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nI know that when Nell is in that mood, walking into a restaurant for dinner is her worst nightmare.

Often when they communicate through what looks like a child being \u201cdifficult\u201d or \u201cmisbehavior,\u201d I imagine it\u2019s the same feeling someone would have feeling trapped in an elevator. \u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nSo if you get the sense your child seemingly is losing it out of nowhere at a place like someone else\u2019s house, a birthday party, the beach, a restaurant, or anywhere else you may find yourself this summer - try to prepare them, and if not, scroll for some things you can do or say don\u2019t when your child seems \u201cstuck\u201d because it may just mean that they literally feel that way. \u2063\u2063", "total_engagement": 14, "engagement_rate": 0.00014049877063575695, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-15T12:28:16.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132068059833, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:18.947Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:18.947Z"}, {"id": 607775132068059831, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1205823157", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:18.944Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:18.944Z"}, {"id": 607775132203565441, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:48.458Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:29.234Z"}, {"id": 607775132203565442, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:48.467Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:29.242Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175219655474, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CtkgsVSMfo8/", "post_id": "3126767825301142076", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/1f06086c76d5f8a10766ec18f7b71294.JPEG", "phash": "bfc4872e157e2708", "image_entities": [{"entity": "friendship", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.40003612637519836}, {"entity": "fun", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3710584342479706}, {"entity": "happy", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.36084437370300293}, {"entity": "people in nature", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3549719452857971}, {"entity": "sky", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.302055299282074}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22622181475162506}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9782942533493042}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9489491581916809}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9161747694015503}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8411741256713867}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7783307433128357}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7528679370880127}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6334995031356812}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5627837777137756}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5505845546722412}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.44826382398605347}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3927246332168579}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2957690954208374}, {"entity": "jeans", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2640492618083954}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2539268732070923}, {"entity": "balloon", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20293304324150085}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-06-22T19:25:39.729Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-07T11:07:06.428Z"}}], "post_text": "Today as Tess and I walked up to the play date we had, I noticed how Tess \ud835\ude33\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f up to them smiling. \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28.

Something I have loved and couldn\u2019t wait to bring Tess to. It took her more than half the time to warm up. I\u2019m grateful that I didn\u2019t pressure her in this particular instance because I\u2019ve definitely done that - said things like \u201cbut we came here to have fun! Look at all the other kids dancing! Come on!\u201d \u2063\n\u2063\nBut on this day, I let her experience it how she wanted and at her own pace.

Because it\u2019s not me showing \u201ctough love,\u201d it\u2019s just me showing the utmost love - showing them they can get through it (even when I feel like I can\u2019t!) \n\n\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20, \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc20\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30 \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20.\n\nScroll for other examples of when love feels tough.", "total_engagement": 28, "engagement_rate": 0.0002809975412715139, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-21T12:27:00.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132068059958, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:19.451Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:19.451Z"}, {"id": 607775132068059957, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "927004236", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:19.448Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:19.448Z"}, {"id": 607775132203565484, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:48.620Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:29.367Z"}, {"id": 607775132203565492, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:48.633Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:29.373Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175223566936, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Ctz-Xz8OxzX/", "post_id": "3131120481155620055", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/69fdb5e9a7db0215de85efeb051f7b4b.JPEG", "phash": "bfd4872e263c8346", "image_entities": [{"entity": "bridegroom", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.49120640754699707}, {"entity": "dress", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3601464331150055}, {"entity": "fashion", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.28890323638916016}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.252218633890152}, {"entity": "photograph", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24817489087581635}, {"entity": "wedding gown", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24065694212913513}, {"entity": "pink", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22763898968696594}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9524398446083069}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9129871129989624}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.881181001663208}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.806647777557373}, {"entity": "sunglasses", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7399405241012573}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7130549550056458}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6567897200584412}, {"entity": "skirt", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6122400760650635}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5376792550086975}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.46235787868499756}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3522276282310486}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.30011844635009766}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.29297006130218506}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-07-16T01:54:57.557Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-07T11:08:22.573Z"}}], "post_text": "What do we do in when our spouse \u201cmesses up\u201d in parenting?\n\nThe shift in this reel is powerful.

comes to mind (guess which one is today and which is from then? \ud83e\udd23 )\n\n\u201cHappy\u201d to me is being with my kids, Matt, my family and having good health, but there\u2019s also the happy that is harder to come by at 40. The carefree happy with a little less worries. Maybe that\u2019s why I think of this photo because I remember the feeling I had in it. I felt like it was one of those times in my life that I had little weight on my shoulders and had the head space to take moments to look around and literally say to myself \u201cI\u2019m so happy to be living.\u201d To me, that\u2019s happy. \n\nLast night matt and I took this other photo almost 10 years later - I thought about how different my life is and how different my \u201chappy\u201d is now. But also that I never ever wanna lose those ten years ago \u201chappy\u201d moments either. \n\nSo my wish for all of you on my 40th is to never think that your purest happy moments, even before kids, aren\u2019t still possible. They are. Don\u2019t feel guilty or inappropriate for holding onto them. I love that when I call my girls from here I feel their happiness for me, in between their missing me, I sense that they get it \u201cmommy is taking time for her for her birthday and we\u2019ll always be here to celebrate for the rest of time.

The \u201cshe never does this with us\u201d or \u201cshe was perfectly fine all week!\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s always when you\u2019re around that they are like this.\u201d It\u2019s why we sometimes second guess ourselves because our children are only this impossible when we\u2019re around. \n\nWhen I was reunited with the earlier girls, I ran to the car, opened the door smiling and saying \u201chiiiiii my girls!!!!!\u201d Tess closed her eyes, blocked me and laid down asking me not to come near her. Nellie reached for me but then was confused by Tess\u2019s reaction and quickly started screaming and crying and saying \u201cbut don\u2019t leave again, come inside home with us.\u201d While Tess was saying \u201cno get away, I don\u2019t want anyone, I want to be by myself,\u201d as she also started crying. Matt stood outside the car confused but I gave him a gesture to give them time. \n\nI would be lying if I said that it didn\u2019t bother me that the reunion I fantasized about didn\u2019t happen but I also knew that this was to be expected with my girls. I knew how many emotions they\u2019d have, excited, happy, probably a little angry, feeling wary, and just overwhelmed and confused by all of those things at the same time.

The first few times Tess did it, I admittedly snapped \u201cstop it right now!\u201d Then I started to almost expect it and I started to snap less but still would heatedly say \u201cI\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re laughing when your sister cries but we have to figure it out.\u201d After the third time of me saying this today, she blurted out \u201cbecause you always focus on Nellie and tell me to stop singing or laughing for her but you don\u2019t focus on me or tell her to stop crying for me!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s so true, the story behind your child\u2019s \u201cmisbehavior\u201d won\u2019t make you angry, it will break your heart.", "total_engagement": 1690, "engagement_rate": 0.016960208741030658, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-07-10T00:13:38.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tess", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "words", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nell", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "times", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nellie", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132068060310, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:21.120Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:21.120Z"}, {"id": 607775132068060307, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1260458765", "created_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:21.116Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T02:29:21.116Z"}, {"id": 607775132203565613, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:49.125Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:29.691Z"}, {"id": 607775132203565620, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:49.141Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:29.700Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175226215993, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CujrXBNuAro/", "post_id": "3144547662686587624", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/de7db7086582d4af209dff134f772e77.JPEG", "phash": "e69d876c076e8354", "image_entities": [{"entity": "dating", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.49362605810165405}, {"entity": "mother", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.32011154294013977}, {"entity": "love", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2484349012374878}, {"entity": "yellow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20819847285747528}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9508292078971863}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8507274389266968}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8235050439834595}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7863209843635559}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7123206257820129}, {"entity": "dog", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.45816248655319214}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23653598129749298}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2101590633392334}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-07-16T16:23:24.874Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-07T11:08:28.979Z"}}], "post_text": "There\u2019s always a moment when we get to choose.

I\u2019m parenting solo and just woke up feeling heavy. The girls wouldn\u2019t play nicely on their own while I got everything ready for camp.

Naturally our children need connection when they need to embark on a day apart and won\u2019t be with us all day. We wonder why they\u2019re so \u201cneedy\u201d and \u201cwon\u2019t play\u201d but sometimes all it takes is 5 min of whatever they want to do.\n\nNell\u2019s anticipation anxiety gets the best of all of us as she asks about camp over and over - so \nI stopped my grind and said \u201cok we have 6 minutes to do whatever you want before we leave for camp!\u201d They asked to dance. With me \ud83e\udee0\ud83d\ude44\n\nIt was hard for me at first - I had so much on my mind and it was the very last thing I wanted to do. But I did, for 7 minutes and we all started our day so. much. smoother. \n\nNo, you don\u2019t need to make up a dance or even play if you don\u2019t like to, just try to give your child a few minutes of focused time when you all need it.

Before we even got in car, Tess was upset she was the last to the car and Nell was in tears about her sneakers and how her cousin and Tess were wearing sandals. I just said \u201cOk, from now on, only smiles!\u201d They looked so wounded. It was kind of ridiculous. Why do they have to only smile? Imagine if someone said that to me - I\u2019d want to slap them. Isn\u2019t it all just about living and experiencing and feeling?\u2063\n\u2063\nI feel like I had a reflective moment in the carride after that, on our way there where, I reset myself and my expectations. I said to myself \u201cJennie, you know that activities like this are a lot for your girls, you know that they get really excited, stimulated and overwhelmed. You also know that there\u2019s three of them to navigate since their cousin is visiting - so you\u2019re also dealing with jealousy and dynamics between the three girls, expect meltdowns, expect chaos, allow it, welcome it, embrace it.\u201d \n\nBasically, I set \ud835\ude33\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude24 expectations.\u2063\n\u2063\nWhen we got out of the car,  I knelt down and said this:\u2063\n\u2063\n\u201cBeing with you girls is my favorite thing in the world. I was having my own hard time, you were having your own hard time, we all had a hard time! Sometimes we say things we don\u2019t mean to say. So I\u2019m telling you right now, you can feel however you feel and I will always want to be with you.\u201d\u2063\n\u2063\nI swear, I believe that these words changed their whole mood for the rest of the night - for the most part. Our children should never be made to feel like a burden for their emotions. And this may be the hardest thing in the entire world to not convey to them. \u2063\n\u2063\nTheir emotions don\u2019t ruin plans, \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b discomfort with

but it\u2019s an activity we also did yesterday. It reminded me of how I\u2019m a firm believer in \u201cput them in water or go outside\u201d when my kids are having those moments of incessant whining, fighting, or just being completely hyper - moments that I know are due to needing to get out energy. Whether it be that witching hour before dinner or after a mental depleting TV session, water and fresh air always help. Sometimes you also just need a second and immersing your kids in play is the definitely the way.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple sensory play experience where your children can discover how water and soap create suds, how a wet sponge can be squeezed to release soap and water, and how mixing and scrubbing can help the soap become even more \u201csudsy.\u201d Also a soap ice cream parlor or cupcake stand is just genius (I even got involved for that!)\n\nA question I love to ask during sensory play is \u201cwhat happens to X when you do Y?\u201d which helps children to discover how sensory materials change when they use them in certain ways. \n\nSo I\u2019ll ask you: what happens to your stress level when you put sponges, soap and water in front of your kids outside?",

When you believe that no sibling is a victim and no sibling is a perpetrator - watch how much that shift fosters a healthier sibling relationship.\u2063\n\u2063\nWatch this video and imagine that my older daughter has wanted to be seen in hundreds of mini moments where she feels my younger daughter quickly joins and \u201csteals the show\u201d - I\u2019m not, by any means, saying that either one of them is the \u201cvictim\u201d in the family dynamic, I am just saying that when you approach your child with the most generous interpretation, you don\u2019t jump in and scold, punish, reprimand one of them constantly as much as you may have. We so often pit one child against the other, I find that it\u2019s rarely about them being against each other but more about figuring out where they stand in OUR eyes. When a sibling does what Tess does in this video, I don\u2019t feel it was directly about Nell, it was about me, my extra attention I remember giving Nell during a dance they were both doing - it was about feeling noticed by me. \u2063\n\u2063\nIf you got this far - this is what I said \u201cOh, no I won\u2019t let you touch her like that, but looks like something is going on\u201d and gave Tess the opportunity to think and self reflect on that too, she doesn\u2019t respond every time but eventually it creates a routine of thinking about why we do something. Of course make sure your children are safe when they are being harmful to one another, of course jump in when you have to, but when you can, pause, take a second to think \u201cwhat may this really be about?\u201d Without victimizing one - you say things like \u201cI saw all of that, what was going on for you guys?\u201d\u2063\n\u2063\nIt can truly change the trajectory of the sibling relationship that we are planting seeds for - sometimes for the rest of their lives. \u2063\n\u2063\n#siblingrivalry #siblingdynamics #sisters #daughters #parentingtips \n\u2063", "total_engagement": 685,

I followed all the rules, I listened, I don\u2019t even remember ever having a tantrum and neither do my parents. \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing with \u201cgood\u201d kids - they need an outlet. They need space to \u201cstretch\u201d and to do some things that are \u201cbad\u201d because if they aren\u2019t given this, if they aren\u2019t urged and invited to draw outside societal lines sometimes, they stay in their safe corner until they explode. The exploding may take years or decades but every \u201cgood\u201d child cracks at some point in their life - been there! \n\nMy suggestion? For every child? Lead them to \u201csafe - bad\u201d behavior sometimes. Back off when you can, stop reflexively controlling or saying no when it may actually be ok to let it go. Give them a few inches even if your reflex is telling you otherwise. \n\nOne of the main reasons I wanted to offer a messy play class at USP was to give parents and caregivers no choice but to let their children participate in something that was entirely up to them - it forces the grown up to let the child be.\n\nI can guarantee if you don\u2019t allow this, if you don\u2019t laugh with your child blowing bubbles once in awhile instead of scolding and controlling them - if you don\u2019t let them create, explore, climb or run - even when the safer, less annoying option is to tell them not to - they will do it on their own in some shape or form at some point - so why not be part of the exposure to healthy, happy, fun self expression and volition.\n\n#Nellsmiddlefingertho \ud83d\ude48", "total_engagement": 773, "engagement_rate": 0.0077575392643885795, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-08-15T23:20:59.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "girl", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "parents", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rules", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "nellsmiddlefingertho"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132172916752, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-19T15:35:43.488Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-19T15:35:43.488Z"}, {"id": 607775132172916751, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1156064265", "created_at": "2023-08-19T15:35:43.463Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-19T15:35:43.463Z"}, {"id": 607775132203565931, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:50.247Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:30.439Z"}, {"id": 607775132203565933, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-22T23:29:50.254Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:30.446Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175249827329, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CwC79jVB1xC/", "post_id": "3171360802188254274", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/ef6b478d8fd4c9d813a414cac393a7b3.JPEG", "phash": "edd4826c074ec787", "image_entities": [{"entity": "child", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5436855554580688}, {"entity": "play", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.35566994547843933}, {"entity": "product", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.32993435859680176}, {"entity": "yoga mat", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2281937152147293}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8246751427650452}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8198946714401245}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5098860859870911}, {"entity": "staircase", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.46392086148262024}, {"entity": "skirt", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.36280950903892517}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.31864914298057556}, {"entity": "bird", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2930896580219269}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.26176661252975464}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-09-04T10:17:50.478Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-07T11:11:56.506Z"}}], "post_text": "I\u2019m without my kids this week and can\u2019t tell you how much I miss taking care of them. Doing the things that often start to feel like chores or tasks - if we let them. \n\nThis may be my favorite reel I have made. When I shared this a year ago it struck a chord with many of you, maybe because having a grandma still is very special - but hope it\u2019s message is something that stays with you far after you watch it. Especially as we head into a new school year. When you\u2019re caught up and treating the parenting journey like it\u2019s a chore, remember this video. I know I need the reminder sometimes too. \n\nBeing a parent is tiring and exhausting. We don\u2019t get a break, we can all agree on that. One thing that we don\u2019t realize is how we let this permeate through our energy and when our children can begin to feel it. We think our children are oblivious to it or won\u2019t realize. We think we can hide it with an over enthusiastic, inauthentic tone, but the rushed hands, the facial expressions when we don\u2019t think they can see, they can see and feel it.\n\u2063\nMy grandmother hadn\u2019t seen me in a year, this was a moment we got to have when she put that sweater on me, something she hasn\u2019t done in decades. We have hundreds of those moments every single day, and so its only human that it can become \u201cchore\u201d like. \n\nSo here\u2019s a reminder, which I do every so often. Start the school year off right. \n\u2063\nOur children are not chores, they shouldn\u2019t feel like they are burdens. When we handle them, let\u2019s take more moments to convey:\u2063\n\u2063\n\u201cI see you, you\u2019re worthy of my time.

it just made my reaction to the prank that much more visceral. Besides the obvious, I realized why this egg cracking prank on young children disturbs me so deeply. I believe in respect for children from the day they\u2019re born. I believe in the @rie.org.official approach to parenting, an approach so deeply rooted in respect for children that they are treated as active participants always. I let my children know, as much as humanly possible, before I touch them in any shape or form. I let them know before I wipe their nose, before I changed their diaper, before I\u2019d pick them up, including them in every process that involved them, because they are just as much people as you and I. And yet here we are seeing video after video of parents all over the world smacking an egg on their child, not telling their child they\u2019re about to hit them on the head, and doing so after they are giving their child the impression that they\u2019re about to be active participants in an activity. An activity where they anticipate that they are being treated like a competent human, and then they are given the shock that they actually aren\u2019t. \n\nJust a reminder that children, no matter how big or small, are people. Somehow, this reminder is needed (kind of mindblowing) because I know that we\u2019d never smash an egg on a grown person and laugh. It\u2019s unclear when, or where or how children became a population to disrespect and it\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m here to continuously set that record straight. Infants, babies, toddlers, children, are all worthy of respect and are no less human than any of us reading this.\n\n#respectfulparenting #parentingwithrespect\n#parentsofinstagram #eggcrackingprank

In different ways they\u2019re trying to get us to connect with them. When we don\u2019t, they turn to their sibling to try to get to us because it gets our attention. Instead of us responding with connection, we respond with scolding and it further disconnects us. Then our child tries harder to get our attention, perhaps with more focus on bothering their sibling to do so, and the whole thing is a toxic cycle.\n\nWhat if instead we made note of this mentally. We thought \u201cah ha! My child needs to connect with me! I\u2019m going to respond with connection, I\u2019m going to say - I wonder what\u2019s going on here! Instead of immediately scolding one and defending the other.\u201d \n\nToday Tess kept nagging Nell on the car ride and I wanted to just scold her.

relate to one of two things (or a combination of both) \n\nOur child is stalling because they don\u2019t want to separate from us.\n\nThey want to be the decision makers and assert their independence (and power). \n\nA visual schedule solves both of these challenges. It gives our child time to connect with us even if it\u2019s a few minutes of discussing what photo comes next in their routine; and nus encouraging them to place the photos on the velcro in the right order. It also gives them comfort in seeing themselves in these photos. It\u2019s like fuel to separate. You can even have your child take one or two with them on the way to school (for instance if you have a photo of them in the car, or on their walk and a photo of them arriving at the school door) even a photo of them giving you a hug for them to take in their backpack! \n\nIt also really empowers our child to feel independent and in control of their own routine. I believe a lot of children are resisting when were just giving orders each morning:\n\n\u201cTime to get up!\u201d\n\u201cTime to brush teeth!\u201d\n\u201cOh that\u2019s nice honey, but it\u2019s time to get dressed!\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019re going to be late, go pee pee!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t blame them for resisting that in the morning, I\u2019d resist that too! \n\nMake this schedule, buy the velcro, it\u2019s worth it a million times over.

I immediately include them by addressing both them and their teachers \u201chow was the day!?\u201d\u2063\n\u2063\n2\ufe0f\u20e3I anticipate it, I don\u2019t show disappointment in it, I remind myself this doesn\u2019t mean that school \u201cbroke them.\u201d I know that school is tiring, it\u2019s hard to eat in a new setting, and there\u2019s so many new social interactions that take a lot of bandwidth. \u2063\n\u2063\n3\ufe0f\u20e3I bring a snack and water at pick up.\u2063\n\u2063\n4\ufe0f\u20e3I give them opportunity to let out their sillies - by running down safe streets, jumping, hopping, singing instead of shushing until they\u2019re in the car and have no ability to control this energy. \u2063\n\u2063\n5\ufe0f\u20e3I try not to focus only on school by bombarding them with questions.\u2063\n\u2063\n6\ufe0f\u20e3I try to be mindful to not be on autopilot after school - instead I try to connect and fuel them up after we\u2019ve been apart. \u2063\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\n7\ufe0f\u20e3I try to remember that I am. their. safe. space. I need to remain that, they\u2019ve waited all day to let this out, how can I then tell them they can\u2019t?\u2063\n\n8\ufe0f\u20e3They can\u2019t apologize for it and shouldn\u2019t, so I\u2019m apologizing for them, they don\u2019t mean what they say or do, they just feel safe to do it all\u2026because they\u2019re with us. So in your mind just think \u201cyou don\u2019t have to hold it together anymore, you\u2019re home.\u201d", "total_engagement": 475, "engagement_rate": 0.0047669225751417535, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-09-08T22:20:59.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "baby", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tears", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "matt", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "space", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "school", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "many", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "energy", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "emotions", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132309090200, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-18T23:48:03.364Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-18T23:48:03.364Z"}, {"id": 607775132309090199, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-526254265", "created_at": "2023-09-18T23:48:03.361Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-18T23:48:03.361Z"}, {"id": 607775132309689803, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-19T08:13:03.950Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:30.843Z"}, {"id": 607775132309689804, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-09-19T08:13:03.956Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T08:33:30.850Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175278694019, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CxB-L6Iu7tg/", "post_id": "3189103508376501088", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/20771af95919b8cbf0f2838cc92a2f8f.JPEG", "phash": "bfd4c02e076f8705", "image_entities": [{"entity": "child", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6073702573776245}, {"entity": "cool", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5336166024208069}, {"entity": "eyewear", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.39284905791282654}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34592556953430176}, {"entity": "facial expression", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3217519223690033}, {"entity": "female", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3002490699291229}, {"entity": "friendship", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2819884419441223}, {"entity": "glasses", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.26569491624832153}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2562900185585022}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2258874475955963}, {"entity": "smile", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20312024652957916}, {"entity": "sunglasses", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9873653650283813}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6226353645324707}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5708462595939636}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2930765151977539}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.25708985328674316}, {"entity": "shorts", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2127881795167923}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-09-19T03:43:48.986Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-07T11:13:16.445Z"}}], "post_text": "I asked my girls separately this same question today.\n\n\u201cWhat makes your heart happy?\u201d\n\nNell said \u201cbeing with youuuuu.\u201d\nTess said \u201cmommy and daddy!\u201d\n\nWe fill their heart with comfort, warmth and happiness. \nWe make their hearts happy. \n\nOur children will become increasingly more of a teen - moods, attitudes, impatience.

Bravery isn\u2019t ignoring our child\u2019s feelings and telling them that \u201cnot crying\u201d is brave. Bravery doesn\u2019t come from children who are raised through threats, bribes, and often fear. \n\nOne time the girls got shots at the doctor. Tess didn\u2019t cry and Nell did. When we were leaving we heard another girl crying and coming out of the room. She came into the elevator with us still whimpering.\n\nI looked at her and said \u201cgetting shots can feel hard!\u201d and Tess said \u201cI got a shot! I didn\u2019t cry! But Nellie did.\u201d\n\nThe girls mom said \u201cwow you are so brave!\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t miss a beat before saying to her child \u201cNellie and you are so brave too! We are still brave if we cry! You all got a shot today!\u201d\n\nThe mom said \u201cyou\u2019re so right!\u201d \n\nI know I\u2019ve said this before but it\u2019s a good time to remind us all of it again - Because when we tell a child that they\u2019re brave because they didn\u2019t cry, we don\u2019t know if they didn\u2019t cry because they held it in, because they suppressed how they really feel, or because they didn\u2019t want to seem \u201cweak\u201d or \u201cnot brave.\u201d\n\nI think bravery is the ability to face fear, to get through a hard situation and to not to hold in emotion.

This morning when I was about to walk Tess into her classroom and wanted Tess to have a nice goodbye knowing I wasn\u2019t going to see her until after dinner - Nell starting getting all upset about her hair bow. I whispered \u201cno more crying over a bow\u201d or \u201cyou have to stop.\u201d \n\nYup. Even I say these things sometimes. Uch.

When they start to, that\u2019s a dangerous point because we have trained our child to turn off feelings. Wanna know what does work? Co-regulation. \n\nIt can take the shape of whatever works for you and your child but after modeling your own regulation and finding a way that resonates with your child for them to regulate with you - preserve that. \n\nHere\u2019s an example:\nNell is upset. I am about to get really angry about it and instead I remember what works. \u201cDo you want a hug, I think you need a hug.\u201d to which she usually resists but kind of thinks about. I come closer to her, open my arms or put her head in my shoulder and that usually results in her melting entirely into me. Other times I may say \u201ctouch my nose\u201d and then we touch noses and breathe for a second or two. Things like this help a child feel safe again.

\ud835\ude38\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude29 my children when they are slow to warm up instead of \ud835\ude22\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude35 them. How pushing a child to do things they aren\u2019t ready to do, even if it\u2019s a \u201chi\u201d wont help them to feel comfortable saying \u201chi\u201d to someone. For years I have honored that about Tess. Knowing this is who she is, preparing her and saying things like \u201cYou can say hi when you\u2019re ready to.\u201d I\u2019m all for showing and modeling to our children the way we should behave in the world. That means, yes we greet people, we say \u201chello,\u201d we smile when we see someone we know, we say \u201cbye,\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201d \u2063\n\u2063\nNow that she\u2019s almost 6, I do feel that she\u2019s at the age where she knows that she needs to say hello to her friends and teachers, even if it\u2019s hard for her to do. I know that inside, she wants to feel comfortable with these things and just needs tools to access so that she can overcome the initial anxiety or discomfort to muster up the courage to greet people (as an example). \u2063\n\u2063\nToday one of my friends asked me what to do because her child is similar. I started talking to her child and her child didn\u2019t answer me. I said \u201cyou don\u2019t have to answer, but if you want to, here\u2019s a game. If you\u2019re having a good time at this party, touch your nose, if you\u2019re not, stomp your feet!\u201d The child slowly smiled and touched her nose. This immediately warmed her up. That\u2019s what a lot of our children need in order to get past that initial \u201cfreezing up.\u201d \u2063\n\u2063\nHere are some more tools:\u2063\nBefore going into a place you know is hard for your child to warm up, prepare them for what they can do when they get there \u201cwhen we walk in, it may feel like a lot of people are there, when everyone comes to say hi, if you\u2019re not ready, you can smile and wave!\u201d \u2063\n\u2063\nPractice beforehand. Role play. \u201cOk Tess, I\u2019m gonna be Dylan, and then I pretend to be her friend and say \u201cHi Tessie!!!\u201d This helps to bring Tess to that place before she\u2019s in that actual place, so that when she is, she\u2019s already had a dress rehearsal. \u2063\n\u2063\nAnd then a similar game to the one I mentioned above - \u201cTess, Dylan is saying hi. I know you want to say hi back, right? If you want to say hi, give her a high five!\u201d", "total_engagement": 25355, "engagement_rate": 0.2544533092478298, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-10-23T00:31:26.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "child", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tess", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "someone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "children", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "age", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132408573967, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-30T05:24:36.178Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-30T05:24:36.178Z"}, {"id": 607775132408573966, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1061331448", "created_at": "2023-10-30T05:24:36.175Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-30T05:24:36.175Z"}, {"id": 607775132408583933, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-30T05:33:36.892Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-22T05:38:04.361Z"}, {"id": 607775132408583934, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-10-30T05:33:36.899Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-22T05:38:04.368Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175317217059, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CyzTTBYO54t/", "post_id": "3221003028534107693", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/ce2c9e35258d1280f637c6b3b0f075de.JPEG", "phash": "bbc5841a2d67d03b", "image_entities": [{"entity": "child", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.40503063797950745}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2694140076637268}, {"entity": "family", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2665434181690216}, {"entity": "heel", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2202194482088089}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9704181551933289}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8677340149879456}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7138044834136963}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6846016645431519}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5806874632835388}, {"entity": "crib", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.45576056838035583}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4431303143501282}, {"entity": "couch", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3935925364494324}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-10-29T03:15:09.097Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-16T20:46:51.106Z"}}], "post_text": "How do I stay this calm in the face of their discomfort?

It made me think of this video and how putting myself in my kids shoes almost always helps me to support them better.\u2063\n\n\u2063I shared this video a few years ago. I wanted to really focus on how sensitive it is to feed someone else. How the goal is to connect with our child but it\u2019s also a process for our child to learn to trust their own body. To tell us when they\u2019re finished, to read their cues and signals for when they\u2019re not, but most importantly to keep this as a process that is about them. \u2063\n\u2063\nWe have to ask ourselves: Do we feed our\u2063\nchildren with respect or with an agenda? Do we feed them to get it over with? To rush? To get as much food in? To limit the food? Because we don\u2019t trust their own bodily cues? Because we know what their bodies need better than them?\u2063\n\u2063\nDoes your child throw food? Why? To experiment? For attention? To protest? To assert their independence? Because we\u2019re rushing? Not focused on them?

But to be their own built-in best friend? To be able to talk to themselves about how someone else\u2019s behavior does not change the way our child should feel about themselves?\nThat isn\u2019t inevitable, but these are things we can help them with. I remind them that when others do things or say things that don\u2019t feel right, that means that person is having their own hard time. (I even remind them of this when I lose my patience or yell, that\u2019s my own hard time!)\n\nI also remind them over and over that they are their own best friend. This is truly so powerful. This helps them to remember that their self worth does not depend on others feelings, opinions, behaviors or inclusion of our children. Their self worth is always there because they have a voice inside that says: \u201cHey Tess! I\u2019m right here, I love you just like Mommy and Daddy love you and I am always here for you.\u201d\n\nI think that using these tools is the closest thing to a hurt feelings immunization that we can get.

everything the same just to avoid conflict or hard feelings.\n\nThat is, until I turned around and realized I became the mom who reflexively DID keep it all equal.\n\nHere\u2019s why: my own guilt. \n\nI realized that with every conversation I had with one of my girls, I felt guilty when it wasn\u2019t equal. Almost as if things each of them had were an indicator of my amount of love or something. The conversations felt hard to have. For awhile, and often still, they even dress the same because of it. I wanted to avoid \u201cI want her dress! Why did Nell get that dress and I didn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nWe all have different reasons for why we may want to keep things \u201cequal\u201d between siblings but I\u2019m your guinea pig, I regret it. You can never keep up with equal. Fair doesn\u2019t always mean equal or having the same exact thing. \n\nTheir birthdays was the first real sign of this. For the last three years I did their birthdays together to avoid one having the spotlight and not the other. Except this year Tess was upset that Nell\u2019s actual birthday is on 11/4 and was always going to come before Tess\u2019s which is 11/30. \u201cWhy is Nellie\u2019s birthday before mine? Why every year?\u201d\n\nJealousy became pervasive. I realized that me keeping things equal wasn\u2019t helping - it was avoiding a very real thing that they need support and tools with NOW for the rest of their lives. Comparing and jealousy.\n\nSo I started over. I stopped getting them both the same exact things, I started responding to one\u2019s questions of \u201cwhy does only she have it?\u201d with \u201chmmmm let\u2019s try and figure that out together.\u201d I started having conversations with them instead. Asking things like \u201cwhat feels wrong with her pancake being bigger?\u201c\n\nToday at Nell\u2019s party, Tess was genuinely happy for her. Nell sat in a literal throne the entire time and Tess sat there smiling with her.\n\nDo I blame myself for the roadblocks they\u2019ve had in dealing with jealousy? No. Do I think I was helping them whatsoever by trying to always keep things \u201cequal?\u201d No shot.", "total_engagement": 666, "engagement_rate": 0.006683727231672437, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-13T00:11:59.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "everything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mom", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "conflict", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "birthday", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tess", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "parenting", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nell", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "siblings", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "birthdays", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132458587473, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-18T06:30:33.151Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T06:30:33.151Z"}, {"id": 607775132458587471, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1670379507", "created_at": "2023-11-18T06:30:33.124Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T06:30:33.124Z"}, {"id": 607775132458728640, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-18T08:02:03.294Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-02T10:14:21.584Z"}, {"id": 607775132458728641, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-11-18T08:02:03.300Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-02T10:14:21.589Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175340690912, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CzpZ85Au_O4/", "post_id": "3236231942789395384", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/e58fe83939cc59d04b4e4fd8051e5962.JPEG", "phash": "ee9491637a2f9161", "image_entities": [{"entity": "child", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3474133014678955}, {"entity": "product", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34476178884506226}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3015313744544983}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7489362359046936}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.49829214811325073}, {"entity": "dress", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3319413959980011}, {"entity": "crib", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.31254082918167114}, {"entity": "scarf", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3087388575077057}, {"entity": "blouse", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.30406779050827026}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2959020733833313}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2069292813539505}, {"entity": "dress", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20078587532043457}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-11-17T21:47:02.804Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-30T04:44:12.538Z"}}], "post_text": "When you look into what causes a child to be a perfectionist, it\u2019s having a highly critical parent, who puts pressure on a child, and who sets impossibly high standards for their child.

I want to believe that for the rest of her life when anyone tells her to \u201cstop crying, stop being dramatic, stop being so sensitive\u201d that she\u2019ll have the confidence and trust in her emotions (herself!) to remember that voice.", "total_engagement": 768, "engagement_rate": 0.007707361132018666, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-22T00:48:31.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "parent", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "child", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "answer", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "holiday", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "family", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mom", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "adults", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tess", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "messages", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "holidays", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Hobbies & Lifestyle", "confidence": 0.9381256699562073}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132480810423, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-27T00:19:09.046Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-27T00:19:09.046Z"}, {"id": 607775132480810422, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "391614823", "created_at": "2023-11-27T00:19:09.038Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-27T00:19:09.038Z"}, {"id": 607775132481109829, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-27T11:11:26.396Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-13T09:30:55.629Z"}, {"id": 607775132481109830, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-11-27T11:11:26.407Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-13T09:30:55.634Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175347774821, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz_VWAhuvOO/", "post_id": "3242404128101168014", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/aa23be5b28aea549d994944e225ae621.JPEG", "phash": "ebd0953e686a913c", "image_entities": [{"entity": "adaptation", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2724289000034332}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6969752907752991}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6775123476982117}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5780649781227112}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.45939671993255615}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4178013205528259}, {"entity": "sweater", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.27193689346313477}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2032075822353363}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-11-25T00:40:43.429Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-09T13:20:38.159Z"}}], "post_text": "Probably one of my most favorite traditions we created last year.

Most likely it\u2019s just a sign of their \u201cimmature\u201d way of thinking. Black-and-white thinking. For a lot of children, it\u2019s hard to access the gray area of reasoning. They think in all or nothing terms. If we say no to something, they just focus on all the things we say no to. If they aren\u2019t enjoying something, they focus on not enjoying anything. It\u2019s a less mature thinking process, especially when a child is dysregulated or stressed.

It\u2019s a tactic we use and almost feel good about because it can feel like it brings us closer to one of our kids in a way.\n\nBut think of why we use this tool: to avoid one sibling feeling upset. \n\nThink more about what this tool does each time:\nDoes it help the child who were keeping this secret from, until when? When do they learn to accept disappointment when their sibling gets something they can\u2019t have if we are always avoiding them feeling it? \n\nIt also tells one child they should be sneaky about getting something the other sibling can\u2019t get, and that they have to keep it a secret because something good for them can make their sibling feel bad. It enmeshes feelings and can make one child feel almost responsible for another\u2019s. Like they\u2019re the protector of their siblings feelings. It\u2019s too much responsibility. And what dynamic are we instilling with encouraging sneakiness like this?\n\nIf you\u2019re a parent who uses this tool, maybe even \u201cdon\u2019t tell mommy I gave you an extra candy!\u201d We see you dads! Lol but regardless, don\u2019t feel badly after this reel. This is as much for any for you as it is for me. Start small, start by noticing each time you go to use this tool, is it once in a blue moon or is it regularly? \n\nAlso it\u2019s important to note that telling a child to keep any \u201csecret\u201d can be dangerous. We don\u2019t want anyone else telling them something is ok and is \u201ctheir little secret\u201d so it\u2019s good to avoid getting into this habit. Do we want they to grow up thinking it\u2019s normal for adults to say \u201cdon\u2019t tell?\u201d\n\nThis came to light for me the other weekend when nell was having a sleepover with a friend and Tess wasn\u2019t.

I couldn\u2019t let it go. I couldn\u2019t leave without looking in \u201cone more place.\u201d I didn\u2019t let her know I was looking and looking because she was handling it well.

Something feels very necessary and real and urgent about it even if no one understands why. \n\nI have had 39 years to grapple with this feeling and I can tell you that if anyone said to me this morning \u201ccome on we have to go, it\u2019s not a big deal\u201d I would have wanted to cry lol. What I would have wanted was someone to come over and say \u201cI\u2019m not sure why you want her to have these boots so badly but I see that something about it feels very important to you.

But so many of us never go to that corner, but that corner is always there and when we never go there, we never grow as a person, but also as a parent. We continue to stay away from that corner and then our children grow up to never go to that corner either.

I need help to calm down!\u201d \u2063\n\u2063\nIt stopped me dead in my dysregulated tracks and I was floored that my child, only on this earth for 4 years, was able to, in the midst of emotional chaos, recognize what she needed. Instead of swallowing, suppressing, muscling through - she said what most of us are unable to say even at 30, 40, 50, 60 years old. \ud835\uddea\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc29 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc26 \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc27. We never learned how to help ourselves to calm down. So we yell, we form bad habits, we have constant anxiety, we distract, we ignore, and we let it all pile up. \u2063\n\u2063\nNext time you or your child is having a tough time, use this line out loud \u201c\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc1e need help to calm down!\u201d \u2063\n\u2063\nImagine, just imagine, in those moments that feel so out of control as a person, as a couple or as a family, if you could say \u201chold on! We need help to calm down!\u201d How. Much. Better. We. All. Would. Be.\n\nCover photo @briarrosephotoco", "total_engagement": 301, "engagement_rate": 0.0030207235686687743, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-12-22T00:29:02.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132585554343, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-26T08:38:14.224Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-26T08:38:14.224Z"}, {"id": 607775132585554336, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1707298569", "created_at": "2023-12-26T08:38:13.855Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-26T08:38:13.855Z"}, {"id": 607775132595388268, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-28T16:02:16.782Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T12:26:32.543Z"}, {"id": 607775132595388269, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-12-28T16:02:16.786Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T12:26:32.548Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175377459289, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C1N092Bu0LU/", "post_id": "3264498253231243988", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/4a94d8da3b2c7b04ddb63bde4bc9d16a.JPEG", "phash": "86097be4a75a8573", "image_entities": [{"entity": "child", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9952180981636047}, {"entity": "family taking photos together", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8182052373886108}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5023025870323181}, {"entity": "family", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3237302303314209}, {"entity": "photograph", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30814993381500244}, {"entity": "tree", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2839318513870239}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9727370142936707}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9707257151603699}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.785923957824707}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.469755083322525}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4393930435180664}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.43745937943458557}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2980136573314667}, {"entity": "belt", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20308978855609894}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-12-25T17:50:41.447Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-10T10:06:18.211Z"}}], "post_text": "These three words are my gift to you for the holidays \ud83c\udf81\n\nUse them. \n\nHappy holidays from us.

Tess went from happy to jealous. It took everything in me not to shut her down as \u201cnot being grateful.\u201d I\u2019m sharing it here because I learned something. \n\nHere\u2019s what happened: Tess got upset her gift wasn\u2019t as \u201cgood\u201d as Nellie\u2019s which came with a few extra accessories. Yes this is when the \u201cwhat a brat\u201d thoughts came into my head too. When I reminded her how much she initially loved her gift she stormed off to her room. I thought \u201cI am just gonna let her stew, so rude of her, so ungrateful.\u201d But something made me go into her room as I said to myself \u201cjust be there.\u201d \n\nI walked in and said \u201cI thought you would like something different than Nellie, if you\u2019re still feeling like you want hers we can exchange it.\u201d After some silence from her and pouting, I said \u201cok I\u2019m just gonna lay here.\u201d After a little, she turned and said \u201cthank you mommy.\u201d I said \u201cfor what?\u201d She said \u201cfor being in here with me.\u201d \n\nWe never solved the jealousy tantrum in that moment but she got through it and so did I. The next day we went to the store and I offered to \u201cexchange\u201d her gift. She didn\u2019t want to. She wanted to keep hers. \n\nHere\u2019s the takeaway: I think a child sometimes feels our love wrapped into things like this. I believe Tess initially thought \u201cmommy must love Nellie more, her gift had more than mine.\u201d Once I gave her the time vs my anger I believe I reassured her that my love has nothing to do with these gifts, and that\u2019s when her jealousy faded. \n\nNow go through this scenario imagining if I had said \u201cyou\u2019re so ungrateful Tess! I went and picked these gifts!\u201d Or anything I initially wanted to say. You may still think she was rude, but I think she\u2019s a child experiencing things for the first time and that I, as the adult, have the opportunity to help her experience them. I\u2019d rather help my child understand gifts are gifts and that the size, shape, or amount has nothing to do with how loved they are and that the solve for wanting something else isn\u2019t to be shamed into \u201cforced gratitude\u201d or to go out and get it.", "total_engagement": 25737, "engagement_rate": 0.25828691856089114, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-12-27T00:53:59.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "everything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tess", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nell", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "girls", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nellie", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "holidays", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "gift", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132608991141, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-06T15:52:24.188Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-06T15:52:24.188Z"}, {"id": 607775132608991140, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1813347479", "created_at": "2024-01-06T15:52:24.185Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-06T15:52:24.185Z"}, {"id": 607775132609472437, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-07T08:30:47.282Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-22T10:21:27.047Z"}, {"id": 607775132609472438, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2024-01-07T08:30:47.286Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-22T10:21:27.053Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175388037020, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C1YLGgau3un/", "post_id": "3267410355294010279", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/ce2abee9b843954beaf526ffb00f3c8c.JPEG", "phash": "e897876c916d9638", "image_entities": [{"entity": "facial expression", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7705546021461487}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.492326021194458}, {"entity": "photograph", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.27176156640052795}, {"entity": "product", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2543511688709259}, {"entity": "snapshot", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21563559770584106}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20839618146419525}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9697969555854797}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9684540033340454}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9152372479438782}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7574318051338196}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4685104787349701}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2775031328201294}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2024-01-05T06:31:06.490Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-17T13:19:02.327Z"}}], "post_text": "Resharing the reel that I shared in honor of Matt\u2019s birthday last year because it\u2019s an important one. \n\nHappy Birthday to the dad and husband who reminds us every single day just how valuable and loved we are, and who truly doesn\u2019t have to raise the game on how to show us.

There\u2019s something really transformative when you experience deep sadness while being the rock of your family. It reminded me that two things must almost always be true. We can go through some of the hardest times in life, we can let our guard down, even as a parent, and also feel so unbelievably grateful in between, making sure to express that too. 2023 taught me that being vulnerable, being honest in how we feel, is how we remain the strongest pillar in our family. There\u2019s nothing heroic about pretending to be a superhero while our kids are young, only for them to feel pressure to be the same until one day they find out it wasn\u2019t true. 2023 taught me that the truest way to parent is by being true to myself and my family. By telling my kids, appropriately, when things feel hard instead of muscling through and leaving them in the dark. \n\nMy girls learned about some of the hardest things that even we as adults struggle to talk about. But I also made sure to tell them and show them during the smallest moments when I was happy. I made sure to radically have fun even when every fiber of my body didn\u2019t think I could. Even if it was just while tying their shoe, taking a second to smile and say \u201cI love being with you.\u201d Or when I\u2019d turn on a song in the car after an epic meltdown before school and we\u2019d start singing.

But let me tell you, when we can find our calm in the face of things that can automatically evoke immediate stress, we are doing something huge for our children. We are expressing trust; not only in our children (that empowers them to trust themselves) but trust in ourselves and our ability to get through any day of parenting (and there are many of them). \u2063\n\u2063\nI could go on and on about how our mentality and attitude is contagious for our children but instead I\u2019ll say to read below for how you can adjust some of your reflexive responses.

So I just set boundaries \u201cnot gonna let you poke her like that\u201d and then I made more connection points \u201cbut I am gonna sit right here, put my phone away and play I spy with you both!\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s like responding by finding ways to reassure our children with one important reminder:\n\n\u201cYou know that I am always your parent and love you very much. I am also your sibling\u2019s parent and love them very much too. I am a parent to both of you.
