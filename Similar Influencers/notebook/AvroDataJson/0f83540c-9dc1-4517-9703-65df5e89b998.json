If you are a follower of Jesus, boldly sharing the gospel and standing on the truth of God\u2019s Word in this dark generation, you will face persecution of some kind.\n\nSadly, many strive to live a life of avoidance. Love somehow is preached as passivity and standing for truth becomes too controversial for their standard. They become afraid of disagreements and upsetting the masses, which ultimately lures them into a life of people-pleasing and bowing to a culture that will bully every word they try to speak. A change of perspective is needed.\n\nInstead of avoiding persecution and backlash, we need to accept it and expect it as a response that comes with the territory of a believer. Why do we live afraid of something that we are told is a blessing? Probably because we know it\u2019s not easy. But to suffer for the glory of God is an honor, and the moment we begin to look at it that way, we will embrace it with the strength of the Lord. No matter what comes our way. \n\n\u20221Peter 4:12-16// \u00a0Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ\u2019s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy. If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people\u2019s matters. Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter.", "total_engagement": 1702, "engagement_rate": 0.0296717281776817, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-11-30T02:18:34.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "culture", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "follower", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "jesus", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "many", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "truth", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "god", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "response", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "blessing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Family & Relationships", "confidence": 0.9846818447113037}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132169920751, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-18T04:19:58.533Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-18T04:19:58.533Z"}, {"id": 607775132169920750, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-887642598", "created_at": "2023-08-18T04:19:58.528Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-18T04:19:58.528Z"}, {"id": 607775132178349263, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T23:06:47.781Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T12:12:19.973Z"}, {"id": 607775132178349266, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-21T23:06:47.797Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T12:12:19.988Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175092131058, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Clm7jyCL6aQ/", "post_id": "2983333746829141648", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/30a18cbc6cc1be317f77565365cc2bf2.JPEG", "phash": "94a1ca3f3e3c2ec2", "image_entities": [{"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.990016520023346}, {"entity": "document", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6421204805374146}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5687527656555176}, {"entity": "white board", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2253624051809311}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8153587579727173}, {"entity": "business card", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6756337881088257}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-06T01:05:46.142Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-25T04:41:42.666Z"}}], "post_text": "Just a reminder to stay focused on what truly matters.\n\n\u2022Psalm 62:8- Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us.

For it\u2019s so hard to see when my eyes are on me.\u201d\n\nHow easy it is to fall into the trap of self-glorification. \n\nThe enemy enjoys to overplay his hand in this area. He is continually hard at work to entice us in keeping an obsessive eye on ourselves, craving praise and adoration, basing high importance merely on the outward appearance, being seen and well known, being applauded and validated by others, and appearing successful and perfect.\n\nThese toxic concepts are always presented as subtle thoughts that, acted upon, aggressively spin into idols that soon become more valuable than pursuing the things of the Spirit and simply living free in the acceptance and love of Jesus.\n\nMy reminder is simple today: take inventory of what has captured your attention. What glorifies the flesh is ultimately not glorifying God.\n\nIt is important to note I am not insinuating that giving honor to others or having success is wrong. Romans 12:10 says to outdo one another in showing honor. But when done in the biblically accurate way, this honor will in return, give glory to God instead of ourselves. That is the key.\n\nThe amazing truth is, we are new creations in Christ Jesus and we are no longer of this world. We do not adhere to worldly principles, ideologies, concepts and desires. Those things are dead to us and have been crucified with the flesh. Now; we are in this world living to glorify God, preach the Gospel, and shine the truth of His Word wherever we go. This is our mandate, our bottom line and our focal point.\n\nIf you find yourself often struggling in these areas, my advice is simple: look to the cross and remember what we are all deserving of apart from Jesus. This always helps me to combat pride and to keep my eyes on what truly matters.\n\n\u2022Galatians 2:20- I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.\n\n\u2022Galatians 5:24- And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh

How do you encapsulate years of prayers, desires and longings of the heart into a caption accompanied by photos? No matter what I type, words do not bring sufficiency to the gratitude I have for what God has done in my life, and within my family.\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted twins, and this desire started very young. My dad is an identical twin, and growing up watching the close relationship he has with his brother always left me desiring that special bond for my children someday. \n\nSo I prayed. \n\nI\u2019ve prayed many prayers for children. God graciously gave us Galilee.\n\nI prayed many prayers for twins. Did I have faith it would happen? Sometimes. But to be completely honest, my faith was very small. \n\nInfertility and loss can drastically change the way you look at things. If you\u2019re not careful, the pain and trauma can create a sort of lens, where you view things in a way that God never intended. The potential to become cynical, bitter, jealous, hopeless, fearful, and angry is quite real, and it takes intentional prayer to stay out of that depressive mindset despite the circumstances. I have many friends who have walked this road and know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nBut, nevertheless, I prayed for what I deeply desired, but more importantly, I prayed above all else for *God\u2019s will* to be accomplished in my life. At the end of the day, I want what He wants for me, because with or without children\u2026with or without twins, He knows what is best. I truly have built my life upon that. \n\nWhy He decided to gift us with twins, I\u2019ll never know. He gives and He takes away; I\u2019ve experienced both. There\u2019s nothing \u201cgood, perfect, and deserving\u201d about us that would persuade Him into doing so. There\u2019s no specific prayers or words we offered. It\u2019s just His goodness, kindness, mercy and sovereignty that made a way. His will is always best, whether it matches our heart\u2019s desires or not.\n\nThere\u2019s so much more I want to share about all of this, but I\u2019ll end it here for now. Glory to God for what He has done\ud83d\udc9b \n\n\ud83d\udcf8 @amandatallonphoto", "total_engagement": 4786, "engagement_rate": 0.08343648123289343, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-24T19:51:48.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "sort", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "heart", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "matter", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "gratitude", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "god", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "caption", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "photos", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "desires", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "children", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "words", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thoughts", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "twin", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "prayers", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "amandatallonphoto"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132169920926, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-18T04:20:20.832Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-18T04:20:20.832Z"}, {"id": 607775132169920925, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1582906836", "created_at": "2023-08-18T04:20:20.820Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-18T04:20:20.820Z"}, {"id": 607775132178349917, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T23:06:49.699Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-13T06:10:41.253Z"}, {"id": 607775132178349920, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T23:06:49.706Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-13T06:10:41.330Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175140989431, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn0Gq2iLzI6/", "post_id": "3023070582925111866", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/6093ce602823cedfb8eaceb6138674c0.JPEG", "phash": "94a9ca3d3ec16a36", "image_entities": [{"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9822991490364075}, {"entity": "document", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6226996183395386}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5178757309913635}, {"entity": "white board", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2901384234428406}, {"entity": "business card", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9117633104324341}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.633093535900116}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-05T23:46:32.569Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-07T14:57:08.132Z"}}], "post_text": "You are in charge of what you allow your eyes to see and your ears to hear.

You have the words that give eternal life.\u201d\n\nAmen.\n\n\u2022Hebrews 11:6- And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.", "total_engagement": 1682, "engagement_rate": 0.02932305922142222, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-30T01:26:53.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "everyone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "world", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "victory", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "draw", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "promise", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "wells", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "words", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "faith", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "god", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "distraction", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Family & Relationships", "confidence": 0.9835165143013}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132169920944, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-18T04:20:23.687Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-18T04:20:23.687Z"}, {"id": 607775132169920943, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1489424736", "created_at": "2023-08-18T04:20:23.684Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-18T04:20:23.684Z"}, {"id": 607775132178349993, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T23:06:49.901Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-13T06:10:43.735Z"}, {"id": 607775132178349997, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T23:06:49.908Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-13T06:10:43.812Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175146549525, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CoD7mS_LzSZ/", "post_id": "3027525490994787481", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/a2af0108c66ec379ab88a51e10e9d7be.JPEG", "phash": "94c9ca372e953fc0", "image_entities": [{"entity": "advertisement", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8996100425720215}, {"entity": "brochure", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5019271969795227}, {"entity": "paper", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3529176712036133}, {"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3324872851371765}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2905229330062866}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7298229336738586}, {"entity": "business card", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5395715236663818}, {"entity": "document", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.30165573954582214}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T00:14:15.608Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-07T14:59:41.068Z"}}], "post_text": "I\u2019ve been listening to the old hymn, \u201cTurn Your Eyes Upon Jesus\u201d, today...and it has taken me to a place of assurance and remembrance of the Savior we love and serve.\n\nSometimes, the old hymns just have a way of doing that! \n\nI\u2019m going to add the entire set of lyrics below, but there\u2019s one particular part that I also love so much.

It\u2019s a declaration from Jesus, and if anyone had the right to speak on this matter, it would be Him.\n\nDuring the ministry of Jesus, He was often wildly misunderstood. As a matter of fact, a group of religious men known as the Pharisees and Sadducees would often follow His travel plans to attend His gatherings all for one purpose: to try and catch Him in some sort of error or hypocrisy (Matthew 22:15, Mark 12:13). They once even accused Him of working with the ruler of demons, Beelzebub, to cast out demons (Matthew 12:24). \n\nJesus, however perceived their intentions. Yet despite their hatred for Him, Jesus can never be found in a stature of forbidding them to attend where He ministered. Time after time they were given opportunities to look past their religion and instead perceive the new covenant of relationship. But they completely missed it. Their theology had no room for a suffering messiah from Nazareth. They were looking for a prestige King that fit inside of their box of worldly interpretations.\n\nGod often does things outside of our understanding, and if we merely judge based upon what we see, we too can be found in error of missing what God is doing in our midst.\n\nSo I want to encourage you today. As you continue serving the Lord, there will be people who will choose to be fully committed to misunderstanding you. You\u2019ll live under their microscope. You\u2019ll be judged and dissected. You\u2019ll be accused of many things and you\u2019ll be the subject of countless smear campaigns...but so was Jesus.\n\nAnd unlike Jesus who was fully God and fully man, absent of all error and folly, you WILL make mistakes along the way.

We\u2019ll see. I miss encouraging and sharing scripture with everyone; it\u2019s one of my most treasured things to do.

You\u2019ll be unmoved by the praise of men and you will live with holy unction.\n\nContinue on, friend, the cost is well worth the reward! Keep your eyes on Jesus and your perspective on heaven.\n\n\u2022James 1:2-5// My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing. If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.\n\n\u20222Timothy 3:12- Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.\n\n\u2022John 15:18- If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.\n\n\u20221Peter 4:12-14// Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you. But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.\n\n\u20222Corinthians 12:10- For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.\n\n\u2022Luke 6:22- \u201cBlessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man!\u201d\n\n\u2022Romans 8:35- Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

Then in verse 6, He sent them away with an important declaration;\n\n\u201cAnd blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.\u201d\n\nOffense can attractively present itself as a reasonable response when hurt is present. Jesus understood this and He was aware of the schemes of the devil.\n\nConsider this: John the Baptist is sitting in prison and he is going to be executed. Perhaps he didn\u2019t think his 6 month ministry as a forerunner for the Messiah was going to end like this. How easy it would be to fall into confusion and doubt everything he stood for...including Jesus.\n\nJohn and his disciples had to be open to God\u2019s unfolding plan despite it not matching their expectations. The good news is; the kindness of Jesus reached out with understanding and compassion. He immediately combated the possibility for offense.\n\n\u201cBlessed is he who is not offended because of Me.\u201d\n\nHurt happens. Things won\u2019t go as planned. People will do things and it will cause pain. I\u2019m not excusing bad behavior, but I am inviting you to be set free.\n\nLiving offended is a choice. Hear me please; LIVING OFFENDED IS A CHOICE. It\u2019s false justice. It\u2019s also bait given by the enemy. Because if the enemy can grab ahold of your hurt, he will transition it to offense. And if that offense sits long enough, it will soon sour into bitterness.\n\nFriend, please do not live in a constant state of offense. Do not live offended by man nor by God.\n\nAttend to the wounds in your life, pray and release this to the Lord. Ask Him for the help you need to forgive and let go.\n\nRemember: Forgiveness isn\u2019t saying the offense or offender is right; it\u2019s saying that what Jesus did on the cross is right.", "total_engagement": 3027, "engagement_rate": 0.05277104652987221, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-09-12T14:31:30.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "are you", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "question", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "followers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "state", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "jesus", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "matthew", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "john the baptist", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "concern", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Family & Relationships", "confidence": 0.9917424917221069}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132305840749, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-17T22:35:11.356Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-17T22:35:11.356Z"}, {"id": 607775132305840748, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1086197613", "created_at": "2023-09-17T22:35:11.349Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-17T22:35:11.349Z"}, {"id": 607775132306038820, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-18T03:38:06.902Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-13T06:10:57.432Z"}, {"id": 607775132306038821, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-09-18T03:38:06.907Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-13T06:10:57.593Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175274798691, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CxI1sevr4Ay/", "post_id": "3191036489126346802", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/5e9b268e5a64dbdbdb6358a7162e14b5.JPEG", "phash": "dc8ba3943a639c9c", "image_entities": [{"entity": "atmospheric phenomenon", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9498762488365173}, {"entity": "lake", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9208601713180542}, {"entity": "land", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7033981680870056}, {"entity": "mist", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6142892241477966}, {"entity": "natural landscape", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5806816220283508}, {"entity": "nature", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5747265815734863}, {"entity": "outdoors", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5472819209098816}, {"entity": "bog", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5113152265548706}, {"entity": "marsh", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.41458502411842346}, {"entity": "pond", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34505695104599}, {"entity": "swamp", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.29373496770858765}, {"entity": "reflection", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.29057037830352783}, {"entity": "sky", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.27391907572746277}, {"entity": "water resources", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2341601699590683}, {"entity": "water", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22229702770709991}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-16T02:46:29.401Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-07T15:10:34.170Z"}}], "post_text": "\u201cI was wrong and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d - Sometimes this is the most difficult thing to say for some.

I know you want to rush this process of grieving and healing, but you can\u2019t. Let God do His work.\u201d\n\nOnce again\u2026surrender. \n\nI went through 5 difficult months of carrying twin brothers\u2026one alive in heaven and one alive here on earth.\n\nSometimes God\u2019s will requires a certain breaking accompanied by many tears in order to get through to the other side of His purpose.\n\nCould He accomplish His plans without the pain? Certainly. But then, I believe, we would miss the opportunity to know Him on an intimate level that seems to sweetly arrive through a certain measure of suffering. \n\nI would have chosen a different way; of course.\nSelfishly, my plans would have never included an early miscarriage, 3 years of infertility, a late miscarriage of our twin and a remaining high risk pregnancy.\n\nBut I\u2019m not living my life unto the glory of Amy; I\u2019m living my life unto the glory of God. And in order for this to be accomplished in all of its fullness\u2026my will has to die so His can flourish. In other words; \u201cnot my will, but Yours be done.\u201d\n\nI want what He wants for me. \n\nFriend, I don\u2019t know where you find yourself today. Whether you\u2019re scaling the high mountain of His tangible blessings, or you\u2019re staggering through the darkened valley of trials and tribulations\u2026I just want to remind you that our Good Shepherd is there, leading you in the midst of both places.\n\nAnd for those who specifically find themselves in the valley, I want to say this; you\u2019re not alone. You\u2019ll be tempted to believe you\u2019re alone, but you\u2019re not. God is no less good, compassionate and sovereign in suffering. I know it may not be what you would have chosen, but will you still stand on His Word and choose to believe that His way is best?\n\nI pray you do. \nI am standing with you \ud83d\udc9b\n\n\u2022Psalm 27:13-14// I would have lost heart, unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.

between flattery and encouragement; did you know that? \n\nFirst, I want to give you the definition of flattery: \u201cexcessive and insincere praise, given especially to further one's own interests.\u201d\n\nNow, I want to give you the definition of encouragement: \u201cthe action of giving someone support, confidence, or hope.\u201d\n\nCan you spot the difference between the two?\n\nIt\u2019s about the heart posture. Flattery is inSINcere and self-seeking. Encouragement is supportive and honoring.\n\nThis may come as a surprise, but there are many verses in the Bible that clearly warn about flattery. Here are a few...\n\n\u2022Psalm 5:9- There is nothing reliable in what they say; Their inward part is destruction itself. Their throat is an open grave; They flatter with their tongue.\n\n\u2022Jeremiah 9:8- Their tongue is a deadly arrow; It speaks deceit; With his mouth one speaks peace to his neighbor, But inwardly he sets an ambush for him.\n\n\u2022Proverbs 26:28- A lying tongue hates those it crushes, And a flattering mouth works ruin.\n\nHow easily this falls under the, \u201cChristian radar\u201d. How common it is among us. Yet how crucial it is to learn the severity.\n\nHave you ever wanted your way in something and knew how to covertly work the other person to get it? That\u2019s flattery. Have you ever given excessive praise to someone knowing you soon needed a favor or wanted something in return? That\u2019s flattery. Have you ever told someone something false because it\u2019s what they wanted to hear just to make them happy? That\u2019s flattery.\n\nFlattery is the \u201csweet talk\u201d of the devil. It devises evil, it is often filled with jealousy and deceit, and it tries to overcompensate and conceal it\u2019s wickedness by giving excessive praise and adoration. Flattery has hidden motives. It\u2019s sweet sounding and it \u201cbutters up\u201d the ears of those who are it\u2019s target. All for 3 purposes: manipulation, control, and deceit. This is the devil\u2019s work and we are to take no part in it.\n\nFriends, may our yes be yes and our no be no. May we encourage one another with truth and humility. May we live and speak honestly. May we use the Word of God as our tool to speak love and honor. May our hearts be pure and right before Him, and others.", "total_engagement": 2907, "engagement_rate": 0.05067903279231534, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-09-19T16:06:01.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "tongue", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "someone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "definition", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "difference", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "action", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "encouragement", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "praise", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132331663014, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-30T08:00:10.172Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-30T08:00:10.172Z"}, {"id": 607775132331663013, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-936679435", "created_at": "2023-09-30T08:00:10.168Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-30T08:00:10.168Z"}, {"id": 607775132333421076, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-02T12:12:23.451Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-13T06:11:08.901Z"}, {"id": 607775132333421077, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-10-02T12:12:23.468Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-13T06:11:09.000Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175287900990, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cxde0QULeHV/", "post_id": "3196846842829464021", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/d87d48970b26be26af4cf383b84586f1.JPEG", "phash": "e8ad97522d2d68d2", "image_entities": [{"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8294820785522461}, {"entity": "nature", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7527775168418884}, {"entity": "outdoors", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6977048516273499}, {"entity": "plant", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.503214955329895}, {"entity": "sky", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4636770188808441}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.39119046926498413}, {"entity": "tree", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.36173346638679504}, {"entity": "vegetation", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2839641571044922}, {"entity": "flyer", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8859719038009644}, {"entity": "gate", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.37842753529548645}, {"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23234382271766663}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-28T00:39:25.491Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-07T15:14:20.493Z"}}], "post_text": "Living for the approval of others is an idol that must be destroyed.\n\nIt\u2019s time to get bold in your obedience to God and making the right decisions for your family, regardless of whether or not others agree with you.\n\nIf you don\u2019t decide what\u2019s right for you and your family, especially according to scripture, make no mistake about it, someone or something else will decide for you. \n\nThis world is filled with differing opinions.

Yet, what I find interesting is verses 3-21 expound on the fact that we as believers are called to come up higher, live in holiness, and expose the unfruitful works of darkness.\n\nPlainly put: walking as children of the light means not engaging in the sins of the unbelieving culture. We love people; but we don\u2019t sin with them. \n\nI point that out because present day, standing up for biblical truth will now label you as harsh and hateful. Somehow, we have come to the conclusion that love equals passivity with no room for correction. \n\nIn Ephesians 5, Paul reiterates the type of conduct that is expected of a believer. Paul says that what we tolerate and basically sugar coat matters just as much. He calls it out by name, go read the entire chapter.\n\nBut here is my favorite part. In verse 11, he not only tells us to avoid fellowship (friendly association) with the unfruitful works of darkness, but he takes it a step further and tells us to instead, EXPOSE the unfruitful works of darkness. It\u2019s a stance of defense and offense.\n\nSo why was it so important for Paul to instruct us in this way? Because we have been called out of darkness and into the marvelous light of Christ. When we fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness/sin, when we have friendly association with darkness/sin, when we dilute down the severity and passively justify our apathy toward darkness/sin; we are in error and Paul says we are deceived.\n\nFriends, may deception have no place. Ephesians 5:1-2 says to be imitators of God as beloved children and to walk in love. Walking in love provides grace; but walking in love also means being rooted in truth. And as we read on to verse 11, truth is not afraid to denounce and expose the unfruitful works of darkness.\n\nTherefore neither should we.\n\n\u2022Ephesians 5:8-11//For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light (for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth), finding out what is acceptable to the Lord.

He also used the mistreatment of others to refine the character of Joseph.\n\nIt all had a purpose. \n\nThe end result? Joseph became a trustworthy leader, second in command to Pharaoh.

It may or may not be persecution that leads to bodily harm or death, but nonetheless, we will endure the persecution as it is by definition: hostility and ill treatment. \n\nSadly, many strive to live a life of avoidance. Love somehow is preached as passivity and standing for truth becomes too controversial for their standard. They become afraid of disagreements and upsetting the masses, which ultimately lures them into a life of people-pleasing and bowing to a culture that will bully every word they try to speak. A change of perspective is needed.\n\nInstead of avoiding persecution and backlash, we need to accept it and expect it as a response that comes with the territory of a believer. Why do we live afraid of something that we are told is a blessing? Probably because we know it\u2019s not easy. But to suffer for the glory of God is an honor, and the moment we begin to look at it that way, we will embrace it with the strength of the Lord.

And that\u2019s simply not true.\n\nAs I\u2019ve been reading through the gospels lately, there\u2019s one thing I notice of Jesus that has been really speaking to me a lot: He took time for people.\n\nIt was almost a complete shock to many. The religious leaders during that time sectioned themselves off from society and often didn\u2019t associate with the \u201csimpletons\u201d.\n\nYet, Jesus arrives on the scene and operates a different way. He doesn\u2019t just preach a message; He actually lives it. He doesn\u2019t require prestige glory and honor, instead He arrives to seek, serve and save the lost. \n\nWho was this Man who took time for the sick, lame, depressed, and demon possessed?\n\nWhat business did He have, as a Jew, to travel through Samaria to speak with the outcasted woman at the well?\n\nWhat was He thinking to bend down to the woman caught in adultery to look her in the eye when everyone else looked down on her?\n\nWhat about all of the people He healed? He touched those who were untouchable to society. \n\nHe listened to the woman\u2019s story with the issue of blood as she shared her suffering and pain. \n\nHe wept with Mary and Martha out of compassion for their grieving. He reached out, He listened, He comforted, He provided truth. \n\nI\u2019m convicted by this. I want to be more like Jesus. I really want to do better in this area. I want to listen well, love others well, and yet not sacrifice the truth of the gospel...all at the same time.\n\nDo you feel the same?

And walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.\u2019", "total_engagement": 5881, "engagement_rate": 0.10252610658809992, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-12-23T18:43:34.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "jesus", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "boy", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ark", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "god", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "will", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Family & Relationships", "confidence": 0.9794586896896362}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132598031373, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-29T21:57:11.689Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T21:57:11.689Z"}, {"id": 607775132598031372, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1417021845", "created_at": "2023-12-29T21:57:11.684Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T21:57:11.684Z"}, {"id": 607775132600510412, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-30T14:42:10.992Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-25T04:08:24.563Z"}, {"id": 607775132600510413, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-12-30T14:42:10.996Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-25T04:08:24.571Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175384754368, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C1SEWT8rktM/", "post_id": "3265691805230713676", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/b52fdb8fafd98d159212218b2de905b0.JPEG", "phash": "b03ac7e563123a7a", "image_entities": [{"entity": "advertisement", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8351023197174072}, {"entity": "brochure", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7839214205741882}, {"entity": "flyer", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.760141134262085}, {"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7208268642425537}, {"entity": "paper", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6289545893669128}, {"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.605883002281189}, {"entity": "document", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3680647611618042}, {"entity": "letter", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34895846247673035}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.32630234956741333}, {"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7055165767669678}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5613714456558228}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-29T22:58:09.968Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-21T10:46:02.120Z"}}], "post_text": "Jesus Christ is Lord!

If you\u2019re not careful, you will end up forming an unjust opinion of someone merely by the malicious words of another.\n\nPlainly put, it\u2019s aiding and abetting in the destruction of someone\u2019s character, and God takes that very seriously. \n\nThe Bible warns of this because what is sown, will soon produce harvest.\n\nWords produce life or death. Who you associate with will affect your life negatively or positively because as it says in 1Corinthians 15:33, bad company corrupts good morals.\n\nFriends, take inventory of what you are saying and what you are listening to.\n\nConfiding in a trusted friend about your life issue is ok; but doing it with the intent to wrongfully and maliciously talk about someone else is sin. It all comes down to our \u201cwhy\u201d.

They once even accused Him of working with the ruler of demons, Beelzebub, to cast out demons (Matthew 12:24). \n\nJesus, however perceived their intentions.
