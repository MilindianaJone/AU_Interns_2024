downtime in one of our previous classes so we whipped up some cream and were taught how make a one-handed quenelle (by the way she\u2019s dipping the spoon in hot water). she mentioned how there are countless different ways to make quenelles, but this is the method she wanted to teach us! the way she demonstrated as always with chefs made it look so easy even though it\u2019s definitely something you have to practice a few times before getting down. i thought this was a really great in depth tutorial so i wanted to share with all of you! if you have any questions feel free to comment below or

school @iceculinary is our pastry final! there\u2019s a lot to get into so let\u2019s get straight into it. the exam was simple by itself, making an almond raspberry tart we had made back in the first few classes of our pastry unit. but for the first time we weren\u2019t separated into two groups which meant the kitchen was gonna be packed. i felt solid about everything so i got right into getting the dough and filling for my tart prepared before taking my written exam. the written exam was a bit more extensive and we hadnt reviewed much for it so it was more difficult than usual but i got through it (we haven\u2019t gotten the grades back yet but i think i got above a 90??). then for finishing the tart it was a little bit stressful because with everyone opening the oven and finishing their written exams at different times it was hard to judge when you should check your tart yourself. i pulled them out though and felt really good about how they looked! then the unfortunate miscommunication about the frangipane recipe and in the moment i was pretty stressed about it, but looking back i still did my very best that day and that\u2019s all that really matters. the pastry unit has been full of fun from day one and a huge step away from the savory things we have been doing, so i am excited to step back into some new international cuisines! want to thank you all so much for supporting, every course/module i finish just makes me think of how far we have come together, there is so much learning still to be had. and as always if you have any questions feel free to

that we were getting graded on making a very specific amount of filling from a recipe on a sheet of paper he handed out a few weeks ago. i had absolutely no clue that was how the test was getting graded, and so i was definitely confused by the grade i got, but at the end of the day it was my fault. in the end i think i made a great product and i learned so much this module that i would have never approached before. i am also so grateful for all of you following me through this whole journey, i hope you learned a lot from the pastry unit and we\u2019re back to savory. as always if you

favorite things i learned in our pastry/baking unit in culinary school @iceculinary !!! it was only three weeks of classes, but it was packed full of recipes and concepts to do. my favorites were the frangipane tart we made to begin and for our final, the pizza we made mostly because we had a fun time sharing slices with friends, the flan and panna cotta because they were just so delicious and one of my favorite sweet things we made, the challah bread because it came out so satisfyingly and it was our first time learning about yeast, then finally the focaccia simply because i had always wanted to make it and it was so satisfying dimpling it and then seeing it come out so perfectly! it was a great unit, had some ups and downs but i have improved a lot since we started which makes it all worth it. i hope you all enjoyed, i have to hustle to prep for a dinner party i have tonight so hope you all have a great christmas weekend, if you have any questions feel free to comment below or message me directly! happy holidays everybody :D\n\n#reels #culinary #culinaryarts #culinaryschool #culinarystudent #culinaryexperience #chef #food #cook #cooking #review #favorite #list #relax #calm

everyone!!!! and here is the chinese x french fusion dinner party i threw last night for the holidays! hope everyone is home or somewhere comfortable and relaxing. for the dinner i had 5 courses, 2 appetizers, 2 main entrees, and dessert! starting with hand-ripped chili noodles persillade. the persillade was so fragrant and sharp with the savory chili oil and fresh cucumber and arugula was honestly one of my favorite bites. then the spring rolls, from light and acidic straight to fatty and rich with the creamy truffle butter sauce. the first main was a chinese fish en papillote which i think was my most fun fusion idea, topped the bass with bok choy, eggplant, peppers, and nothing better than sharing a tasty broth and scallion steamed fish. then the duck with a pomelo reduction sauce and the edamame garlic puree (didn\u2019t like the end plating all too much) was super balanced with all of it\u2019s components. the final dish was fuji apple tarte tatin and i finally made a good dessert for one of my dinner parties. with the almond cookie whipped cream, it was so good. i had a lot of fun with this one and prepped and conceptualized it in the least amount of time so far! i really hope you all enjoyed, i hope youre enjoying time to yourself or with friends and family, if you have any questions feel free to comment below and merry merry merry christmas all

everyone! on september 19th i started posting my culinary school videos and i could have never ever ever imagined how much you would all enjoy them. i starter posting because i had been making volleyball content and while i was taking a break wanted to do the same for my culinary journey. who knew it would be so fun explaining and documenting everything i have been learning and now i get to do it for over 140,000 of you. this video is a thank you and a little reminiscing on the very first cooking videos i used to make in my college apartment which i can\u2019t even believe was a year ago. from learning how to hold a knife to creating recipes and being able to do so much more i hope you have been improving and enjoying cooking as much as i have these past few months. and i will always be grateful for those that have been here since the beginning and are still just joining. i am on a train to my first ever trail just months after really learning how to cook, and i am nervous and excited to keep on going with all of you! and as always, if you have any questions feel free to comment below or message me directly, to many more hundreds of days \u2764\ufe0f\n\n#reels #culinary

made for my dinner party last night! the concept was japanese french fusion and i had a menu of tempura, onigiri (kinda), udon, steak, and creme caramel. this was such a fun menu to create and i was really happy because i was stressing thinking about ideas when i thought of the confit duck onigiri and then the rest of the dish ideas started coming in. the tempura was served with a miso honey hollandaise, a little tangy but nice and sweet with the umami of the miso. the onigiri unfortunately fell apart so i changed the dish and ended up serving it in a miso soup to save it. the udon was mixed with a lot of crab and mussels in a play on sauce americaine (this is the stock i made a couple nights ago). then there was my favorite savory dish the steak with yakiniku sauce, almost smokey from the toasted sesame flavor and balanced perfectly with the wasabi sauce. last was dessert and i finally got it to taste great, plating still needed a lot of work though hahaha. super fun dinner, had lots of fun with this one even though the presentation didn\u2019t turn out well, but hopefully just getting better and better for the next! hope you all enjoy and as always if you have any questions feel free to comment below or message me directly! hope you all had a great weekend and i will see you soon :D\n\n#reels #culinary #culinaryarts #culinarystudent #chef #food #cook #cooking

just me talking about velveting and scallion pancakes because the actual cooking in this day was a little questionable hahaha. regardless it is china day and i learned lots and lots of valuable information about the regional ingredients and flavor profiles of china. we made some walnut shrimp without walnuts because we have a nut allergy in the class, as well as the scallion pancakes which i didn\u2019t think i made too well unfortunately. everything actually turned out okay and it seemed like a lot of people in class enjoyed the food so turned out to be a good day in the end. i actually have an exam coming up soon i am studying for so sorry if i dont reply to comments or dms for a few days, but still feel free to comment below or message me and i will get back to you as soon as possible to answer your questions :D\n\n#reels #culinary #culinaryarts #culinaryschool #culinarystudent #culinaryexperience #chef #food #cook #cooking #learn #learntocook #asia #asianfood #chinese

out (we ground everything together later to get a more consistent filling). it was a nice and relaxing day just wrapping things and i got to go around and make everything at least once. we also made a bunch extra for a special event which was fun because other people would be eating our dumplings! very good day of practice for me today and the potstickers tasted great which i was happy about. hope you all enjoyed, as always feel free to comment below if you have any questions or message me directly, hope you have fun things planned for the weekend, because i have some exciting stuff to

used to make inspired by niangao (and also a twist on my sister\u2019s recipe) every week in college because it was cheap and made so much food i could eat it for dinner and have leftovers for the next day. i know i excluded sesame oil and soy sauce because they are staples in my pantry and i don\u2019t even think about restocking them. im sure it is also pretty unlikely you are buying a singular potato or head of garlic for your recipes, but if you wanted to make this dish it would only set you back around 10 dollars and it is so quick and easy i was able to do it in my dorm before i went to culinary school or knew anything about cooking really. i\u2019ll put a rough recipe down below but the video shows most of it and the measurements for soy sauce and sesame oil are mostly to taste since they\u2019re the main flavorings for the dish! if you have any questions feel free to comment below or message me directly, I actually have a few trails set up for this weekend so gonna rest up and see you in the next :D\n\nniangao recipe (untraditional):\n1 chicken quarter (trimmed, diced)\nsalt & pepper (lightly seasoned, salt mostly from soy sauce)\nsoy sauce (a few tbsp)\nsesame

Thailand. we learned about all sorts of traditional ingredients and how theyre used, then i got to make a green coconut curry. often times in Thai cuisine the spices and aromatics are ground into a paste before being added to coconut milk or other flavored bases which shows off the many influences on Thailand from its neighboring countries. once i made my paste and had all of my ingredients it was just a matter of putting everything together (i wish i had a little more curry paste) and the end result was delicious. i had a lot of fun learning today and i hope you all enjoyed. sorry for the

creme caramel which is similar to a flan and also extremely easy to make. all it takes is 5 ingredients and you could actually flavor this however you want as long as you mix it in properly with the base flavors! creamy custardy, but make sure to be careful with how much caramel you add otherwise you might end up with a hardened top bit. super tasty, so so fun to pop open (cut around the edges, then release by puncturing the mold) great for friends and family or just for yourself! the recipe below yielded about 18 of those small circular muffin molds that i used in this video so you can definitely scale down if you are cooking for less (or i prefer just making them larger hahaha). hope you all are having an amazing weekend and if you have any questions at all feel free to comment
