The characters are interesting without being obnoxious; the setting is captivating, and the storytelling superb. Book feels so completely exotic and alluring. The story pulls you in and the romantic interaction between the leads leaves you wanting more. Nothing more you could ask of a steamy novel.\n\n\u201cThe Placeholder\u201d is a very well written dark romance novel. It may not be a literary classic, but it entertains and fulfills our need for romance immensely. The characters felt believable and more importantly, they felt intense.\u00a0\n\nOverall liked the novel, would re-read, and suggest that you give it a go, if you are a dark romance fan.\u00a0\n\nHighly Recommended", "total_engagement": 453, "engagement_rate": 0.04174345742720236, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-13T14:27:53.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "romance", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "anyone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "romance authors", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fan", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "work", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "romance", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "characters", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "romance fan", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9986711740493774}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132057055477, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-03T10:20:46.085Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T10:20:46.085Z"}, {"id": 607775132057055474, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1339713609", "created_at": "2023-08-03T10:20:46.081Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T10:20:46.081Z"}, {"id": 607775132184033672, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T04:53:20.775Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-03T03:02:20.412Z"}, {"id": 607775132184033675, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-22T04:53:20.786Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-03T03:02:20.420Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175097849827, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CmKBb5oh5Vj/", "post_id": "2993211217696757091", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": "Orange County, California", "latitude": 33.6769, "longitude": -117.776}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/853858398c3817418599589e03d9b12e.JPEG", "phash": "e66d899a98b23666", "image_entities": [{"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.690462589263916}, {"entity": "hand", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4664318561553955}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20046329498291016}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8751313090324402}, {"entity": "bird", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5179653167724609}, {"entity": "tie", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3347143232822418}, {"entity": "animal", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.286857008934021}, {"entity": "flag", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2856457531452179}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.28536349534988403}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-06T06:42:18.951Z", "updated_at": "2023-07-06T18:25:09.144Z"}}], "post_text": "Midpoint: A Memoir by Patricia Angeles is an amazing memoir about pursuing happiness no matter what, because you deserve happiness.\n\nThere is a wealth of material out there about happiness.\n\nPerhaps your \u2018taste-buds\u2019 have been tempted by reading about happiness \u2013 either on this website, in your practice, or forming research.\n\nYou would have found that there are some fantastic books on what is a very broad topic.

Hopefully, by knowing more about what this book is all about,\u00a0 by reading this review of one my favourite book Midpoint: A Memoir, you can decide weather you want to read it or not.\n\nMidpoint: A Memoir explains that we each hold the key to our own happiness. It argues that, by training our hearts and minds, and by actively working on our attitudes and outlook, we can all achieve happiness.\n\nIn terms of its effect (that is, the evocation of happiness), I'd have to give this book five stars plus. The reading of it, however, was a bit of a chore until I found the adventure humorous.\u00a0\n\nAfter reading this book I became more philosophical, more conceptual.

In fact, fantasy novels written by horror authors often get categorized as dark fantasy. For other people, fantasy novels that are a little grittier, a little bloodier, a little more.

Journey into these thought-provoking worlds and behold the majesty of traditional gothic elements delivered with a modern style. Inspired by a true love for the Macabre and the unnerving atmosphere of the Gothic genre, author Giuliano Olivotto has gathered together some of the greatest stories in this amazing supernatural anthology.\n\nThe tales within this haunting collection are of dark places and shadows, catacombs and hidden passages, secrets and curses. There are stories of deception, possession, despair and remorse, betrayal and of course ... death.\n\nI give \u201cThe Deathless, the Dreamless, and the Other Dark Fellows by Giuliano Olivotto a 4.4/5 and would recommend this to any reader that is looking for extreme, shocking, lucid dreaming and crazy supernatural. It was very well written, had some nice twists, and the ending was pretty intense.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s creepy, weird, gross, beyond extreme, and the ending was so unexpected that I was completely shocked. I won\u2019t ruin anything for you but once everything unfolds, you\u2019ll also be making some weird faces as you read. It\u2019s just too crazy, you know? I enjoyed all the cryptic chapters and it just really blew my mind that Giuliano Olivotto could come up with story that is so twisted and quick to read.\n\nWould I Return to it Again: Absolutely. Its a book that will haunt you, but a book that demands a deep sense of exploration.

This book would get more than five stars if it were allowed. This is one of the best books I ever read, and I am always reading something. Though it is 'fiction', the author uses a lot of words and phrases that were used in old times. Researched well, as far as I know, I think a lot of the dialogue and episodes were from primary sources (non-fiction accounts). The more interesting aspect, however, is the intricate portrayal of lead character.\u00a0\n\nIf you enjoy the tales of the Old West, this book is for you. The book is written in such a manner that you can feel the heat of the summer sun or the biting cold of the winter.

It has some of the same ineluctable atmosphere that made Matthew Hughes\u2019s paranormal books such a popular success.\n\nHorror is a peculiar genre. If it\u2019s meant purely to scare, what is scary? What might shock one reader is laughable to another. Ghosts, serial killers, great heaving monsters, the loss of self-control. Ghost Dreams by Matthew Hughes is an amazing piece of bone chilling novel in which characters are running for their lives. As much as horror is a genre it\u2019s also a technique; a way to confront or explore something real by taking the audience to extremes. As a kid I was terrified of horror films \u2013 until I actually watched one and then I couldn\u2019t get enough. But what really stood out about the films and books I loved the most was that more often than not the horrific aspect was only one part of what made the story special. The best horror has something more on its mind than just scares, and indeed finds a way to use the scares to explore whatever that something is, and\u00a0Ghost Dreams\u00a0by Matthew Hughes\u00a0is one those amazing books.\u00a0Ghost Dreams\u00a0totally got into my head to the degree that it found it's way into my dreams. I was so involved with the story and characters that they made my head their home. The characters are so superbly written.\n\nIf I have not made it clear that I recommend this book then I suppose that I have no gift for recommendation.

It was a way to channel my imagination and my emotions into something beautiful and meaningful. I have always been fascinated by the wonders of the universe, the mysteries of alien life, and the power of love.\u00a0That\u2019s\u00a0why I chose to write an alien love story that blends science fiction, romance, and adventure. My inspiration came from many sources, but one of them was the song E.T. by Katy Perry. I loved the idea of falling in love with someone different from you, someone who challenges you and makes you grow. I also loved the game Mass Effect, which showed me how rich and diverse a sci-fi world can be. I wanted to create my world, with my characters, and share it with others.\u00a0\n\nCan you tell me about the book? \n\nIn my own words, from my imagination, it is a fairy tale of a beautiful girl named Seyai who is from an amazing galaxy beyond the stars, she comes to earth to find her one true soul mate which happens to be Zevran who is a handsome gentleman that is a biology teacher and it is something cosmic love at first sight However I don\u2019t want to give any spoilers so I would just say if you are looking to be taken on a powerful, epic galaxy ride you should read my book. My book is about Seyai, a girl who feels like she does not belong anywhere, an alien princess who is searching for her soulmate, and Zevran who is a handsome human teacher who is saddened by the circumstances in his life and yearns for love and true happiness. Their paths cross in a way that changes their lives forever. They face many obstacles and dangers, but they also discover the beauty of each other\u2019s cultures and hearts. They learn that love is not limited by boundaries or differences, but rather transcends them. I think many girls can relate to Seyai because we all have felt different or out of place at some point in our lives. We all have dreamed of finding our true love, our perfect match, our soulmate. And we all have wondered what it would be like to meet someone from another world, someone who would show us new horizons and possibilities.", "total_engagement": 684, "engagement_rate": 0.06302985624769628, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-06T11:28:13.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "someone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "love", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "love story", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hobby", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "book", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "wonders", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fairy tale", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "seyai", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "imagination", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "universe", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "girl", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "zevran", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "soul mate", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "emotions", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Books & Literature", "confidence": 0.9543884992599487}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132458847913, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-18T11:30:33.820Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T11:30:33.820Z"}, {"id": 607775132458847912, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "866426515", "created_at": "2023-11-18T11:30:33.815Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T11:30:33.815Z"}, {"id": 607775132461353203, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-19T06:02:53.188Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-02T07:53:30.837Z"}, {"id": 607775132461353205, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-11-19T06:02:53.196Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-02T07:53:30.844Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175338553462, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CznNeNdpqEo/", "post_id": "3235614107934040360", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/f4ce37b931ae6553e7d670cfd5557221.JPEG", "phash": "b842e7279a369cd1", "image_entities": [{"entity": "accessories", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.674788236618042}, {"entity": "accessory", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6273773908615112}, {"entity": "eyewear", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5820020437240601}, {"entity": "glasses", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34685513377189636}, {"entity": "purple", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23806925117969513}, {"entity": "violet", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2240307480096817}, {"entity": "crystal", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20598509907722473}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8290753364562988}, {"entity": "glasses", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.603102445602417}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5590202212333679}, {"entity": "sunglasses", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4515036642551422}, {"entity": "computer monitor", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.34003496170043945}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.26471182703971863}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-11-17T02:19:09.318Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-29T14:58:43.097Z"}}], "post_text": "Extraterrestrial Love\" by Lilith Morningstar takes readers on a captivating journey through the intergalactic quest for love.
