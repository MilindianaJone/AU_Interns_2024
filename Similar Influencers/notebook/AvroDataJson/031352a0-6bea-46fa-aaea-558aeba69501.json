Or that exercise doesn\u2019t look hard. It\u2019s not about making things hard. \n\nWhat I am trying to show you here is the difference when you do an exercise without support, guidance or feedback vs when you have a teacher who cares about you and wants the best for you ( that\u2019s me\ud83d\ude18). \n\nJosepha has had many surgeries for #breastcancer & #ovariancancer. She also had radiation to her pelvis and breasts. I understand the long term side effects of radiation to the abdomen and pelvis myself. \n\nThe 2nd picture on the right you can see Josepha isn\u2019t using her core to lift her arms. Look at her hips push forward, her back away and her arms go higher over her head. Bigger doesn\u2019t mean better.\n\nAfter curing her to focus on her core 360 ( and more) her posture totally changed. She also said her back felt better\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffbThe win\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\n\nIf you need help understanding why your back hurts after surgery I can help you. You could have had surgery 56 years ago like Josepha and still benefit from learning correct core technique.

Even if you don\u2019t think you do. I want you to imagine you have two sides. A light side & a dark side. The light side is all the positive qualities within yourself. The dark side is just the opposite. It\u2019s that voice that tells you that you are not enough, you don\u2019t matter, you are not worth it. That voice can get very dark.\n\nI know that voice very well. In my past I was ashamed of that voice because I was told it was BAD to feel sad. It was BAD to complain about your feelings & when you did people would think less of you\ud83d\ude2d So I held my sadness in for many years.\n\n\u201cNobody cares about your story Emilee\u201d are words I will NEVER get out of my head. When somebody tells you nobody cares about your story that is very hurtful. It\u2019s even more hurtful when it\u2019s your intimate partner. \n\nI am grateful today that I have found a partner who loves all my qualities, both the light and the dark. \n\nToday I can have compassion for people who have hurt me in the past because I\u2019ve learned that we ALL have a story to heal. Cancer was just my catalyst to get a jumpstart and I am grateful for that because I really could not go on living anymore believing all those negative voices in my head telling me that nobody cares about me. I\u2019ve been to the dark side. I crawled my way back to reinventing the story that I want to create. \n\nI\u2019ve learned that I was very codependent. When you try to please your partner out of fear of rejection or abandonment, it never works. The most important person you need to love and heal is the story with yourself. \n\nI\u2019ll ask again. What is the story you need to heal?\n\nOn the other side of the emotional pain you may be burying is joy, peace and a life you deserve. \n\nTrust me. Life doesn\u2019t happen to you, it\u2019s happening for you. Create the life you want. You do have a choice.\n\nThe story you are telling yourself really is just a myth. Of course I matter.

You might see me on the cover of my own book looking confident, happy and smiling, but I wasn\u2019t. \n\nLet me explain.\n\nI am 100% confident in what I teach, especially to women who are recovering from cancer. What I wasn\u2019t ( past tense) confident in was the belief that I could make a difference in peoples lives. \n\nI doubted myself and my teaching skills because what I teach isn\u2019t what others teach. It makes me different and I never liked being different. As a young child who had cancer and who was bald I wanted to fit in and be like everyone else.\n\nSo it hit me today that I have been hiding my own gift which is teaching.\n\nI\u2019ve been making myself invisible and what I say I really want to do is help people heal and thrive after cancer.\n\nI have a hard time promoting myself because it feels like I\u2019m showing off or bragging. That is another quality I\u2019ve disowned.\n\nBut what I\u2019ve learned is that these disowned qualities that we are triggered by in others are qualities that we all have within us. We just need to RECLAIM them. \n\nI am recusing confidence in who I am and what I do.\n\nWhat are you reclaiming?\n\nNeed help uncovering your disowned qualities? Sign up today to take a LIVE workshop with me Jan 10th and I\u2019ll help you see that the light you have disowned is inside of you waiting to shine bright\u2764\ufe0f\n\nMy FREE workshop is for #cancersurvivors and you can sign up\u2b06\ufe0fin bio under Reinvent Your Life After Cancer link and I\u2019ll send more details soon\u2764\ufe0f\n\nI believe in you.\n\nNow it\u2019s your turn to

In order to feel more peace, I had to create it.\n\nThis journey of finding peace for me started 9 years ago. I was asked by my therapist what two words do you want more of in your life. She asked me to write them down.\n\nI wrote peace & respect.\n\nThere is a lot to these words and I\u2019ll write more later, but right now I am reflecting on these words.\n\nI wanted more peace in my life. My body does not respond well to chaos, screaming, yelling. My body was desperate for something to change.\n\nBy the time I figured this out, it was too late. I was diagnosed with cancer, an incurable cancer I read,ovarian cancer is brutal\ud83d\ude2d\n\nI was desperate for a cure, so I searched outside of the box. I hired an energy healer, a shaman, a Chinese dr, a life coach and an end of life therapist. It was during one of my end of life therapy sessions that I had my AHA moment. I am not ready to die. I have more life to live.\n\nAlthough at the time it seemed impossible, I would go to my moms house in Mt. Shasta to look for healing. I had no idea what I was looking for, except I heard this place was magical and healing. It\u2019s something you have to believe, and so I did.\n\nI would go out on the lake and practice my #yoga and talk to the mountain. I would ask her to please save me and tell her I was sorry for everything I ever did in my life. I talked to her like she was my only friend and she guided me. I know it sounds crazy, but it was my journey.\n\nEvery time I come here I feel so calm and peaceful. We ended up buying a house to remodel during the pandemic and we chose this house because of this view.\n\nIt\u2019s very spiritual place here and before my cancer I was not a spiritual person. What I\u2019ve learned this year is that spirituality can be whatever you want it to be. I\u2019ve found myself and therefore I\u2019m more at peace. This is my spirituality.\n\nMy spirit lives in these mountains and around the lake and the forest.\nI feel most at peace here.\n\n2022 has been one of the best years of my life. I\u2019m looking forward to making 2023 YOUR best year of your life. \n\nI\u2019ll ask you the same question I was asked:\nWhat 2 words do you want more in 2023?", "total_engagement": 198, "engagement_rate": 0.009309761143501976, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-02T16:03:34.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "view", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "peace", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "friend", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "place", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "body", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "peace & respectthere", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "words", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "therapist", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "order", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "journey", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "yoga"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039492597, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:46.605Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:46.605Z"}, {"id": 607775132039492595, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-302430241", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:46.604Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:46.604Z"}, {"id": 607775132175769718, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:49:35.351Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:23:28.800Z"}, {"id": 607775132175769721, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:49:35.360Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:23:28.803Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175119688464, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm9xbRMOD4i/", "post_id": "3007777504316898850", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/05a469821cdfe0ab90cefc03a2d03c33.JPEG", "phash": "941b7ae121e6369e", "image_entities": [{"entity": "circle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7255008816719055}, {"entity": "emblem", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21873581409454346}, {"entity": "pink", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21454016864299774}, {"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9173542261123657}, {"entity": "clock tower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8823127746582031}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.44734877347946167}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-05T22:01:23.817Z", "updated_at": "2023-06-23T17:32:04.609Z"}}], "post_text": "Every year for the past 7 years I have been on a path of spiritual growth, self improvement and transformation. \n\nThe #1 thing that has worked best for me to transform my life is #lifecoaching, but not just any coaching.

It\u2019s been awhile since I taught #bootybarre but I said YES!\n\nI forgot how much fun it is.\n\nTo be honest, it\u2019s been 7 years since I\u2019ve taught because my body was struggling pre and post cancer. Not to mention I had hip surgery for a torn labrum and FAI surgery on my right hip. My barre days were done\ud83d\ude2d\n\nYesterday gave me #hope again. I had given up on #barre \n\nI had so much fun teaching Shawn who is a professional football player that I totally forgot about my hips.\n\nI am watching this video back and I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u201c hey, my form isn\u2019t so bad\ud83d\ude02\u201d. The story I\u2019ve been telling myself is that my body is broken. \n\nI just proved that story wrong!!\n\nIt may not feel it work the same, but it can still do hard things.\n\nSometimes you just need to get out there again and give it a try.\n\nWhat do you want to get back out there and try?\n\nThank you @shawn_poindexter1 for coming to ask me to teach you some exercises yesterday because you showed me that I can still do hard things\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\n\nP.S.

start.\n\nI\u2019ve been sharing parts of my story here for 7 years now. There is SO much more to my story that I want to share that I can\u2019t express in limited text. \n\nI want my podcast to help other cancer survivors like me SEE what is possible when you take action and heal the deeper part of you that chemotherapy doesn\u2019t heal. I know some of you know what I mean.\n\nI\u2019m been blessed to work with some amazing professionals and feel called to pay it forward. \nPart of the hero\u2019s journey that I have been following for 7 years is that when you cross over ( imagine a bridge and you are stuck. You can\u2019t cross, but you want to but something is holding you back) you pay it forward. You pass on the lessons that have helped you. \n\nI am fully ready to share and help you cross that bridge\u2764\ufe0f\n\nWhen you do, you will never look back with regret, anger, sadness or grief. You will have learned to have so much self-compassion for yourself and forgiven yourself and others ( which had been the #1 step in my healing journey). \n\nIn 2013, Oct 7-12 I attended a life changing retreat. That was pre cancer. I had NO idea that if I didn\u2019t change my behavior and my life that I would get cancer again. \nI went home, but didn\u2019t finish the work. Attending a 4 or 5 day retreat, is great, but unless you continue to do the work, you may find yourself falling back into old patterns which could be causing chaos and unhappiness in your life. \n\nI\u2019m going to share my horse story at the retreat that was LIFE changing for me. I have to rush to the studio now to teach, but I want you to know there is more I do than just teaching Pilates & yoga.\n\nI want to help you move forward and never look back with regret.\n\nP.s. I had to look back at the camera and my new life now because some days it\u2019s hard to believe that I DID it.

abdomen froze up and felt like it was being twisted and stabbed with a knife. I tried to focus and enjoy talking to a friend who I haven\u2019t seen, but my mind could not focus. \n\nThose of you who really know me, know that I LOVE food and I love going out to dinner so when Emilee doesn\u2019t order any food, there is a problem\ud83d\ude02\n\nFor a moment I started to experience PTSD of the FEELING of the first time I had a bowel obstruction after my ileostomy surgery. It\u2019s VERY common for ANYONE who has had abdominal surgery, colon surgery to experience this because adhesions form inside. First thought was oh F\u2026\u2026k NOT this again. FEAR and panic set in, but I did not show it to anyone at the table. I just left and went home ( I could barely walk to my car), but I didn\u2019t want to bother anyone ( one of my old stories, I don\u2019t want to be annoying or needy). \n\nWhen I got home, I immediately got in my bed like in this video I made 7 years ago because I had this same horrible pain in the hospital, GAS pain. I gave myself 30 minutes to wait and if the pain didn\u2019t stop I\u2019d go to the ER. You will never imagine the combination of what cured my pain last night. It was almost instant. This pose, Childs pose and I put a pillow under my belly + my husband handed me a Diet Coke to drink. I\u2019m not sure where that came from because we don\u2019t but soda, but it was in our house and saved me. It could be any carbonated drink, but that\u2019s all we had and within a minute I let out the deepest belly burp and OMG the pain stopped.\n\nTrapped gas pain can feel like a bowel obstruction. I am so grateful today I woke up feeling 100% better and that I didn\u2019t have to go to the ER.\n\nHave you ever experienced that kind of pain post abdominal or ileostomy surgery or ileostomy reversal surgery?\n\nWhat helps you when you have horrible gas pain?

I guess I\u2019ve just learned how to adapt to my body. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known.\n\nWhen I met Josepha who also had radiation to her pelvis at age 29 for stage 4 #ovariancancer she was the first person who really understood what it felt like. When you have radiation to your pelvis/ abdomen you are at higher risk for #scoliosis ( we both have that), but we don\u2019t let that stop us from moving and having fun.\n\nToday I was teaching Josepha ( age 86) to get some more #mobility ( movement) in her hips ( as she\u2019s aging, her body is getting VERY stiff). \n\nMovement does NOT have to be hard. Movement should be fun and you shouldn\u2019t hurt yourself trying to do things that your body no longer can do after a major surgery from #cancer.\n\nNurture your body with love & kindness.\n\nJust move!\n\nMovement is medicine. \n\nI use Josepha as my example because I want yo live to be 86 like her.\n\nP.s. she\u2019s very serious when she works out, so I have to remind her to smile sometimes\ud83d\ude02\n\nThe sooner you can move post surgery/ radiation the better to get the tissues healing and blood flow moving\ud83d\udc83\u2764\ufe0f\n\nIf you need 1:1 help, I can guide you and create a weekly movement routine for you using my specific Cancer Core Recovery\u00ae\ufe0fMethod.

It\u2019s there just waiting for you to uncover it.\n\nI remember being 2 weeks into #chemotherapy and crying hysterically. I truly thought I was dying. It felt like I was dying ( that\u2019s what chemo does, it try\u2019s to kill all the bad cancer cells). I was so weak and emotionally on the craziest rollercoaster ride of my life.\n\nI was lost. Searching for myself in an already dark world and then cancer.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the moment when the lights turned on for me. I was in an end of life therapy session ( literally planning my will and trust for my kids) and deciding if I was even going to finish treatment. I had a choice to give up. I can\u2019t make this shit up.\n\nThen, that voice in my head spoke to me. Normally she would say to me \u201c give up, you are not worth it, nobody cares about you, nobody will miss you, you have nothing to live for\u201d. She was a very dark voice. \n\nThen, I heard, \u201cf\u2026. It\u201d let\u2019s do this. You can do this. You are not ready to die. That was the moment. I did feel sorry for myself for awhile, but that got old and that wasn\u2019t moving me forward to the vision I needed to create\u2026\u2026 life after cancer.\n\nI know it seems hard to go into the future when life has you down, but if you can create just one ounce of possibility for a good life after cancer it gives you something to fight for everyday. \n\nFor me it was my kids and my career. I love what I do. I love helping people heal and by me never giving up work while I was going through treatment it gave me a purpose.\n\nFind a purpose. \n\nDream of doing something you have always wanted to do like writing a book, or dancing on a stage, or giving a TED talk one day.

I didn\u2019t realize your final days were coming so soon. BIG regret I have. I know you are well taken care of and you have lived a blessed life.

I hope I see your book published one day, I know you will make it happen.\n\nAngela, I\u2019ve worked with many cancer patients / survivors, but you were something extra special. You and I created a sister bond that only someone who goes through ovarian cancer understands. I am angry right now that there is NOT good treatment or a cure for ovarian cancer, especially for low grade ovarian.\n\nYour spirit and positivity through all of this has shown me that if I ever face death again, I want to be like you. You are my hero. You have shown me that dying can be beautiful and does not have to be scary. Thank you for that.\n\nInstagram family and community, please leave one last message for my sweet friend Angela to let her know how much she is loved from all over the world. Please share where you are at and I\u2019ll be sharing these messages with her and her family. I was told she is sedated right now, but I know she can still hear us\u2764\ufe0f I love you so much @mefit8 \n\nPs. Please give Ken a big hug for me when you see him.

It is my happy place.\n\nI danced in junior high, high school and minored in dance at UCSB. I got a degree in Bachelor Science of Biopsychology.  I love brain science and I love seeing how you can rewire your thoughts after being in a dark place for so long. I know from personal experience that when you put the work in (effort) the results and rewards will follow!\n\nLife after cancer has its ups and downs. One year you feel amazing, the next year depression might set in and you ask yourself why you are depressed when you should be happy because you are alive?\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I\u2019ve been there. I\u2019ve always learned how to work with my thoughts and dive deeper into where it\u2019s coming from ( it\u2019s usually old brain software that hijacked our brain). Thoughts of \u201cI am not good enough\u201d or \u201cI am broken\u201d or \u201c I don\u2019t deserve it\u201d are just a few of mine that I have struggled with and overcame. To be honest, they are sneaky thoughts and are always there in the subconscious just waiting to take over.\n\nOne way I help myself stay happy and focused on my bright future is having a passion project. For the past 7 years it\u2019s been my non-profit @cancercorerecoveryproject and finding a new love of #latinballroom #dance. I never thought I was a good dancer and I talked myself out of so many opportunities because of those limiting beliefs.\n\nThe good news now:\n\nCancer was my wake up call to start LIVING no matter how much time I was told I would live. I DECIDED that my life was worth putting the energy and effort into. This did require me showing up for myself and being my own accountability partner.

can already feel by body responding in ways that I never imagined being possible again!\n\nI am more things wrong with my body than I want to share, but I CHOOSE to focus on what I CAN do today.\n\nI almost gave up on myself and started to feel myself falling back into my old cancer story. I\u2019d tell myself thinkers like, \u201cI can\u2019t do that anymore\u201d and my husband said to me, \u201cEmilee, you don\u2019t have to worry about cancer anymore. It\u2019s gone\u201d! It\u2019s almost like I had to give myself and my body permission to move on, if that makes sense to anyone who is a long term cancer survivor.\n\nI am living my best life. I have never felt happier and healthier and my purpose on earth is to help other women who find themselves stuck in their story post cancer\u2764\ufe0f\n\nI am here for you when you are ready to take that JUMP!!!\n\nNext week I\u2019ll make a JIVE video for you.\n\nThis 2 hour private lesson was focused on SLOW controlled movements. It\u2019s much harder than it looks and to coordinate all the moving body parts together. I did find that taking a break and coming back to dance after I healed all my old stories, myths and beliefs I had about myself that I feel more confident than ever in my body and my skills. \n\nMy point is that WE are the ones holding ourselves back in life!\n\nTake it from me, do what you can while you can! Tomorrow is not guaranteed and YOU can do anything you put your mind to!!! ( you may have to hire me as your coach to bust some of your limiting beliefs to help you get a jumpstart!)\ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nWhat is one belief you tell yourself that you would like to change?\n\nWould would be possible in your life if you healed that belief that is holding you back?\n\nFor example, I never believed I was good at dance. I was always the back up dancer. Never good enough to get a solo or have the spotlight on stage. It didn\u2019t take confidence to get me to where I am today, it took courage!!!! It takes courage to break through old beliefs about yourself. The best part of taking the authentic action, dance, is that it gives me a FEELING of gratitude and appreciation for my body that I never did before.", "total_engagement": 85, "engagement_rate": 0.003996614632311454, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-06T22:04:04.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "women", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ways", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "body", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "movement", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ones", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039493456, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:49.655Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:49.655Z"}, {"id": 607775132039493454, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1802287107", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:49.654Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:49.654Z"}, {"id": 607775132175770007, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:49:36.110Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:23:29.212Z"}, {"id": 607775132175770009, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:49:36.117Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:23:29.216Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175173148565, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CpgM1ZKjjQJ/", "post_id": "3053496993068233737", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/fa84f514ec7d5abd55de441e1e60bc14.JPEG", "phash": "b103c718f8f6169e", "image_entities": [{"entity": "arm", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9825041890144348}, {"entity": "human leg", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9626361727714539}, {"entity": "joint", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9586100578308105}, {"entity": "knee", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8392471075057983}, {"entity": "leg", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8192803859710693}, {"entity": "physical fitness", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7070253491401672}, {"entity": "shoulder", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3539283275604248}, {"entity": "sportswear", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.31586238741874695}, {"entity": "standing", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2732044458389282}, {"entity": "thigh", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20179630815982819}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9825204014778137}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9700628519058228}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9512835741043091}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9332677125930786}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.915605902671814}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20227569341659546}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-05T21:58:36.653Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-25T00:07:31.846Z"}}], "post_text": "What makes YOU resilient?\n\nThe look on my face\ud83d\ude02That is #resilience \n\nThe art of never giving up!\n\nWe are all resilient in our own way.

Just because I\u2019m dancing today and found happiness doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019ve always felt this way. I had to fight myself to get to this place. My message to you today is to keep going, even when you fall! Pick yourself up and put one foot in front of the other. These baby steps will eventually lead you to your higher purpose and path.\n\nMy purpose was far bigger than just surviving #cancer. My purpose is to make a difference in the lives of other women fighting cancer life a better life no matter what. \n\nYou can still live with cancer and be happy. Please don\u2019t wait to start taking care of yourself because for many women that cancer free message never comes. Live today like it\u2019s your last. Say YES to that thing that your heart is called to do. Pick up that phone and call an old friend. Start taking a class that makes you improve yourself which only helps you love yourself more.

Nobody cares about you\ud83d\ude2d\u201d. \n\nThen\u2026..\n \nI pause. I stop because I am AWARE. Most important step in healing is the self-awareness. I ask myself this. Would I tell my daughter nobody cares about her? Absolutely not. I would tell her it doesn\u2019t matter if anyone responds to you. People are busy. Instagram is great to connect, but it limits yours posts. Maybe the person never saw your post. I would tell her that I love her and that the only person who matters is her\ud83d\ude18\n\nThis is how I have to talk to my inner child. The picture of me that sits next to my desk ti remind me when I get down on myself that I am resilient and that I can do hard things.\n\nWhat does your inner critic say to you?\n\nNow that I am aware and know my top 6 shadow qualities I able to respond quicker when I feel my internal shadow being triggered. I am able to pause\u2026 do a worksheet on my trigger and have compassion for this little girl who I fought against all my life.

If I\u2019m not perfect, nobody will think I\u2019m good enough. \n\nStepping on the dance floor has been one way for me to prove to myself that I can still dance, that I still can have fun and I am good enough to compete because I\u2019m the end that\u2019s all that matters.

One is evil- he is angry, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe other is good- he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. The same fight is going on inside you- and inside every other person, too.\u201d\n\nThe grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, \u201cwhich wolf will win?\u201d\n\nThe old Cherokee simply replied, \u201cThe one you feed.\u201d\n\nThis story serves as an important reminder that we have the power over our experiences and emotions.

and all of the things that you tell yourself you are not good at?\n\nThere is something going on with me. It\u2019s actually very exciting. Today during my dance lesson my teacher told me that I am really talented and that this comes so natural to me. He told me I have a gift for this. Normally I wouldn\u2019t share there because in the past I would find it really annoying when someone shows off their talent of skill, and I figured out why. I have disowned a quality in myself. The quality show off. If I dance and show what I\u2019m good at in my mind people will judge me and tell me I\u2019m a show off. So, I\u2019ve overcommitted myself to REJECTING myself, rejecting my talent, rejecting my self-worth and above all, rejecting self-compassion for myself\u2026\u2026\n\nUntil now!!!!\n\nToday I declare that I am no longer going to look in the mirror and reject myself. It\u2019s been a sick dis-ease I\u2019ve lived with since I was a kid. I have also over committed myself to giving compassion to others and not to me ( that is changing too). \n\nThings are really good in my life right now and I honestly believe that all of this self care and self help stuff I\u2019ve invested in the past 8 years has really paid off. \n\nSo, if you look in the mirror and reject yourself too I\u2019d love to help you dig deeper to the story inside of that you tell yourself so that you have have a big shift in your energy, your happiness and your life.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nP.s. not everyone who looks in the mirror loves themselves. It has been the hardest thing for me to overcome and I can look in the mirror today and say I love you and actually feel it and believe it. Now that may be the biggest transformation of my life and I want to help you feel the same \u2764\ufe0f\n\nDM me if you are a woman who wants to learn to have more self- compassion for yourself.

I can understand now why she is anxious and not trusting of others. So, I listened more and gained her trust. That\u2019s all I did. I didn\u2019t judge her or shame her for relapsing into addiction, i stead I told her she was worth living for and that she did matter! I gave her my cell phone and told her if she ever needed me to call me.\n\nSo on that day when I saw her name pop up on my phone I answered. It was a cry for help. \u201cEmilee, I need you. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. I feel like i want to\u2026.\u201d I rushed back to my studio. I told her to wait and not going anywhere. I don\u2019t run because of my bladder problems, but that day I ran to her.\nWhen I got to my studio she just burst into tears crying. I just listened for an hour. I am not a therapist, just a life coach and I recommend she get help. The sad thing is in her situation, she\u2019s been rejected of help. She told me because she was a drug addict she\u2019s been judged and seen as damaged, broken and unfixable. So much of my own story I can relate to Helena. Although I didn\u2019t have a drug addiction, I had another form of an addiction and I also was judged, shamed, abandoned and called crazy, mental, and so many more names. We are humans with a soul. We have a story and inside of us a deeply wounded little girl who needs to be nurtured and loved.\n\nYour story started a long time ago. What do you want your new story to be?\n\nJust a few years ago my story also sounded like nobody cares about me and that I don\u2019t matter. After diving into my story with someone who is understanding and compassionate I\u2019ve been able to heal my inner child. I have a big \u2764\ufe0f and I\u2019ve realized that my purpose in life is changing. My true purpose is to help you heal your story\u2764\ufe0f\nWhat is your story", "total_engagement": 45, "engagement_rate": 0.0021158548053413577, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-08T13:15:05.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "humans", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "streets", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "phone", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "someone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "stories", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "drugs", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "studio", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "helena", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "girl", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "help", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "walk", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039493795, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:50.854Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:50.854Z"}, {"id": 607775132039493793, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1345951668", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:50.852Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:50.852Z"}, {"id": 607775132175770137, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:49:36.557Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:23:29.457Z"}, {"id": 607775132175770141, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:49:36.565Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:23:29.468Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175203516312, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr0pBY4LP2g/", "post_id": "3095279259249081760", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/8e4a1298b66b12386dbfdd62c95f9fa1.JPEG", "phash": "bec1d03ec1d226e9", "image_entities": [{"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9832680821418762}, {"entity": "line", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6476091146469116}, {"entity": "document", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4907006323337555}, {"entity": "letter", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4444092810153961}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30802616477012634}, {"entity": "business card", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5720788836479187}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-05-19T00:40:36.600Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-25T00:14:08.227Z"}}], "post_text": "Another trigger!!!\n\nMy old therapist taught me to NOT respond for 24 hours when something or someone would cause to to feel angry and want to feel like I needed to defend myself. Then, last night in my grief educator course we were doing a lab on our \u201cfeelings\u201d or our \u201cgo to feeling when when get upset\u201d. You usually have ONE go to feeling.\n\nWhat is your go to feeling?\n\nI will be talking more about this later, but it was perfect timing after this message a woman wrote to me after my dishes accident which left my brand new kitchen counter damaged. It was not the dishes that triggered me, and I\u2019m going to save the full trigger exercise for a zoom call and mini workshop to help you. It\u2019s too long to explain here.\n\n#1 Just because I survived cancer doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have feelings and that I should ignore how I feel. This was NOT about cancer, this was about my feelings. So for someone to tell me \u201c to get over it because I survived cancer, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Really triggered me! So, I did another trigger sheet.\n\nBy the end, I was able to have compassion for her for not being understanding or being able to have compassion for my experience. I am grateful to her for opening up an even deeper wound inside of me that needs to be healed. I still allow others  to hold power and control over my feelings, almost stopping me from believing that my feelings matter. \n\nThe good news: I\u2019ve learned to set boundaries with myself and I am NO longer available for feedback that is not supporting me or helping me.\n\nTelling someone to \u201cget over it\u201d is NOT helpful. This comment also triggered the time my ex told me to \u201cget over it\u201d- my story he was talking about. This is the problem, people can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t just get over it. They need to feel their feelings and work through it and then their story can be healed.\n\nPlease be kind to others who are hurting, even when you think they have it all together. You never know someone\u2019s story!\n\nI am vulnerable with my share because I am here to help serve you in healing your story. \n\nI am no longer ashamed of my story and I have set a new boundary when people say mean things to take care of my mental heal.

I had ALL of them, plus more.\n\nMy life changed the moment I was diagnosed with this disease. At first I thought my life was over. I was afraid to die. What I didn\u2019t realize was that I was afraid of dying because I hadn\u2019t found my purpose in life or felt like a made a difference in this world. I felt like a failure. I didn\u2019t know who I was. Thank you cancer for changing that story.\n\n8 years later, I know my purpose. Once you finish through your own #herosjourney you #payitforward by teaching others.\n\nOne way I help others is by supporting survivors through my 501(c)(3) non-profit I started as my pas project. Another was is by sharing my companion book that I wished I had while I was in the hospital to give me something to focus on other than dying and being in pain. My little book travels around the world and it\u2019s helping women reclaim their strength & hope.\n\nToday I celebrate all the women across the world and their loved ones who have been touched by this awful disease. Not everyone makes it out and that makes me so sad and today the only thing I can do is focus on is spreading awareness to other women so it\u2019s not too late for them like it was for me and others.\n\nI do not have any genetic history to this disease. It was totally random\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0for was it?\n\nI\u2019ve been told I got a secondary cancer from my childhood cancer. Basically, radiation to my pelvis gave me ovarian cancer ( who really knows). \n\nMy next dream is to host women from all around the world at a healing retreat at my new house in Mt. Shasta. We will go to healing waterfalls, hike the mountains, yoga, paddleboard, boat, dance, laugh, cry and hug each other knowing that we are all family\u2764\ufe0f I don\u2019t normally ask for help or ask for things out of feeling guilty and undeserving( my old story) but today I am asking for help, not for me, but for others. \n\nIf you feel called to make a difference and to support my passion project you can donate on the link in my bio or \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\ncancercorerecovery.org\n\nXo\nEmilee",

I am more alive then ever and happier than ever.\n\nThe picture of the birth of my first son Hayden. I witnessed a miracle that day as I watched another woman give birth to my child.

It didn\u2019t seem possible, so I stayed stuck in my comfort zone ( pre-cancer). I am here to tell you that NOTHING is out of reach.\n\nMy life was chaos. I was going through a divorce, cancer treatments, trying to run my pilates studio ( I was the only teacher) and trying to hold myself together learning how to be a new single mom.\n\nI was honestly afraid to spend time in this hyperbaric chamber to treat #radiationcystitis that was awakened after more #chemotherapy and #debulking surgery from #ovariancancer. The #1 thing I was fearful of was catching on fire in there. They told me that was possible so I had to shower before I went into the chamber to make sure I had no oils etc on me. Of course I allowed that fear to accelerate in my head. I always went to the worst case scenario. Then, I was fearful I would have an accident on myself ( which I did many times) because my bladder was cut through. I was too proud and too embarrassed to take the diapers they offered me. I said \u201cNO, I don\u2019t need them\u201d, but I really did. Recently I was thinking of this story as I look back 8 years later and I can now see my old self inside that bubble. She was afraid of losing control. She was afraid to be herself. She didn\u2019t want anyone to think she had problems so she smiled, even when she was in pain. She felt isolated and alone and never told anyone because she believed nobody cared around her. Does that girl in the bubble seem like she would be someone who believed that? I share my story because what you see on the outside isn\u2019t what\u2019s what someone feels on the inside.\n\nI have a purpose in life how. \n\nI\u2019ve healed my body, but more importantly for me is that I\u2019ve healed my old story by learning to have compassion for myself, and forgiveness for myself. Healing is an inside job that nobody else can do. I can be here to guide you when you are ready to heal that old story you tell yourself.\n\nWhat is the story you are telling yourself?", "total_engagement": 30, "engagement_rate": 0.0014105698702275718, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-18T13:15:25.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "question", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "cancer", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teacher", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "chaos", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "gift", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "1"}, {"name": "chemotherapy"}, {"name": "debulking"}, {"name": "ovariancancer"}, {"name": "radiationcystitis"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039494398, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:52.949Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:52.949Z"}, {"id": 607775132039494393, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1028148639", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:52.945Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:52.945Z"}, {"id": 607775132175770235, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:49:36.915Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:23:29.685Z"}, {"id": 607775132175770238, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:49:36.922Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:23:29.689Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175219396755, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CtCqFseSS44/", "post_id": "3117239001397407288", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": "Santa Barbara, California", "latitude": 34.4208, "longitude": -119.698}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/2459ad28aedc0541fa1df8d08c479736.JPEG", "phash": "d9f82867f6351606", "image_entities": [{"entity": "arbour", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9681603312492371}, {"entity": "botany", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8163985013961792}, {"entity": "flower", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6306881308555603}, {"entity": "botanical garden", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6301894783973694}, {"entity": "garden", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5230539441108704}, {"entity": "leaf", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.44469234347343445}, {"entity": "nature", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4194367825984955}, {"entity": "outdoors", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3976331353187561}, {"entity": "pond", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.38841092586517334}, {"entity": "plant", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.37604740262031555}, {"entity": "tree", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.33467361330986023}, {"entity": "vegetation", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2701990008354187}, {"entity": "chandelier", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.351219117641449}, {"entity": "painting", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3442362844944}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-06-22T00:34:44.586Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-25T00:17:06.118Z"}}], "post_text": "What if you try shifting your lens?\n\nWhat I mean by this is, what if you shift the way you look at things?

called embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. I had 2 years of radiation and chemotherapy, and of course major surgery when I was 4 years old. It\u2019s a long time ago and my body can still feel the late side effects from the radiation burn. One of the things I struggled with the most has been body shame from all of my scars on my stomach. I felt like I was the only child growing up that had this horrible thing called cancer.\n \nLater in life, I was diagnosed with a secondary cancer from radiation. This time, advanced late stage 3c #ovariancancer. This time around after more surgeries and a new #ileostomy, I struggled a lot with itchy, dry, burning skin. I had to be extremely cautious with any product I put on my scars, especially around my new #stoma (that\u2019s the area where your intestines comes out through a hole and into a bag to release your \ud83d\udca9). Everyday I cried in my bathroom because I felt so alone & frustrated with my body.\n \nUntil\u2026. I met the amazing people over at @larocheposayusa who welcomed me to their family. Honestly, they were one of the best things that ever happened to me. One day, I received a gift at my door. My teenage daughter stole it from me because she loved the products so much\ud83d\ude02 I can\u2019t even tell you how special I felt that day that somebody sent me a gift for being a #cancersurvior. But, even better than that was this special lotion they have for radiation burns, safe for #cancerpatients that NOBODY else offers. I could go on and on how amazing I felt from using their products, but more importantly, I am part of their cancer squad and I now get to help pay it forward! There are amazing opportunities that come with being a cancer survivor.\n \nIn my eyes, you are a survivor the moment you are diagnosed with cancer. I\u2019d love for you to share your story in the comments.\n \n1. What cancer diagnosis(s) are you celebrating today?\n \n2. What is your favorite quote that helped you get through cancer?\n \nOne of my favorite quotes is by #brenebrown \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n \n\u201cWhether you like your story or not, you have the power to change it\u201d.\n \nLove you,\nXoxo", "total_engagement": 149, "engagement_rate": 0.0070058303554636076, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-04T13:34:05.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "child", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "body", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "daughter", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "part", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "alone", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "brenebrown"}, {"name": "cancerpatients"}, {"name": "cancersurvior"}, {"name": "childhoodcancer"}, {"name": "ileostomy"}, {"name": "larocheposaypartner"}, {"name": "ovariancancer"}, {"name": "stoma"}], "mentions": [{"name": "larocheposayusa"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132039494468, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:53.166Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:53.166Z"}, {"id": 607775132039494466, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "643083473", "created_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:53.160Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-02T17:25:53.160Z"}, {"id": 607775132175770259, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:49:37.009Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:23:29.738Z"}, {"id": 607775132175770266, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-21T20:49:37.017Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T07:23:29.750Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175219396719, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CtIGjWoNRaU/", "post_id": "3118771559711708820", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": "Montecito, California", "latitude": 34.4367, "longitude": -119.632}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/f6907a63c731904208eca72015b8b16b.JPEG", "phash": "a6191eb9466ad4ae", "image_entities": [{"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7156840562820435}, {"entity": "eyewear", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5676249265670776}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5067371129989624}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.47983768582344055}, {"entity": "glasses", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.47816962003707886}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3240968585014343}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.26564112305641174}, {"entity": "smile", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20225851237773895}, {"entity": "necklace", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9718133211135864}, {"entity": "glasses", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9427317380905151}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7495949864387512}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5537254810333252}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5183855295181274}, {"entity": "blouse", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5026440024375916}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3053865432739258}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2315445989370346}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-06-22T00:34:44.752Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-25T00:16:23.483Z"}}], "post_text": "\u274cscrolling and listen to this!!\n\nI share Josepha\u2019s story because she is my #hope.

messages. These past 3 weeks have been hard for me both mentally and physically. I do not do well when things feel out of my control. I lost control of my health these past 3 weeks.\n\nI\u2019ve been told by others that \u201cI HAVE to be strong\u201d and honestly, that feels like a lot of pressure sometimes. I haven\u2019t felt strong at all these past 3 weeks. Quite the opposite. But this time I was able to honor my body and give my body the nurturing that it needed. I\u2019m so grateful to all of my clients who have been patient with me and understanding while I am sometimes forgetful. Each day is getting better.\n\nI do not have psuedotumor cerebri, like they thought I might. It was a mini eye strike and I even said to my husband one day, \u201c I feel like I just had a stroke or something\u201d but continued on because I didn\u2019t want to miss @brettyoungmusic in Santa Barbara. \n\nThe good news is my sparkle is coming back\ud83d\ude03\n\nI am back to work which makes me the happiest. I did feel something inside of me shift after this experience. It was one more layer of my heart being cracked open.\n\nThis is me.\n\nI wear my \u2764\ufe0f on my sleeve. I share my story because I know others are out there struggling and suffering in silence. I started this Insta page 8 years ago when I was diagnosed with #cancer. I never thought I\u2019d live one year. Hear I am 8 years later. The thing is I want people to understand about cancer survivors, especially children like me who grow up into adults is that they are really just grown ups in a little kids body. We still get scared. We still get afraid. We still have fear that we are going to get cancer again so I guess what I am saying is to spread kindness and not judgement when you see someone sharing their story. They just may want to be heard or be seen and maybe you are the only person who is listening? You just never know!\n\nMy purpose used to be famous, make a lot of money. It\u2019s no longer that. I just want to touch other peoples lives and make a difference in somebody\u2019s life. That\u2019s it!\nI no longer have the need to be seen! I just want to be heard. I want my story to help someone else.

For most of my life, until just recently I was really mad at you for committing suicide. I\u2019ve learned in my #grief training that we don\u2019t call it that anymore. We now say \u201cdeath by suicide\u201d. For some reason learning about this topic in a way that creates a better picture in my mind that you were not a bad person, I was not a bad kid and that you \u201cdidn\u2019t love me\u201d enough to stay alive for me has helped me heal my old childhood wounds and story around your death. \n\nThe truth is, I was really sad you were never there for me. I never had a dad and that hurt my heart, actually it \ud83d\udc94 But today I can forgive you because it sets my brain free from all of the stories I have made up in my head and all of the what is\u2019s that never happened. I can see the picture all so clear now. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t my fault that I got #cancer at age 4 and then you decided to take your life. But that\u2019s the story my little brain made up and my entire life\u2019s story has been shaped around your death. It\u2019s time to let that go. Maybe it was just my way of holding onto any memory I had of you. This is it. This is all I ever had. A black and white picture. I have no memories of you and that makes me feel sad. I try to be the best mom to my kids so they never feel the loss that I did. But I forgive you. When I was asked to think that maybe you could have had #ptsd from serving in #vietnam and that \u201cmaybe\u201d you came back a different person, it helped me to see that you were most likely fighting with your brain and I now have so much more #compassion for you.  I feel sad for you and all of those who come back changed and suffer with #mentalhealth \n\nI said goodbye to you and watched you be buried in the ground. I saw you in an open casket at the age of 5 and I just don\u2019t think I was ready to process my grief.

#griefeducator with #davidkessler through my own journey through #cancer.\n\nI am #evolving and continue to find the gifts that cancer has brought me. \n\nToday, 8 years #cancer free, I am able to #payitforward, give back and help others find #hope & happiness again\ud83d\ude03\n\nI always thought I would only be helping the #cancersurvivor, but it turns out that in the past few years in my #pilatesstudio I am been supporting more #widows than I could have imaged. \n\nTo be honest, this was a hard relationship to navigate through because I was so close to his wife. I had a lot of survivors guilt, and always felt so bad that I was happy and alive, and his wife didn\u2019t make it from #ovariancancer. \n\nI learned to listen a lot in our #movement sessions. I would literally teach a hip opener and witness the release of #emotions. I couldn\u2019t fix the fact that he lost his wife, but I could help him take care of himself because it\u2019s easy to lose yourself in grief. My client Bruce is one of the reasons I decided to become a grief educator. I help my clients #heal pain & hurt through the physical & emotional body. It is what comes natural to me\ud83d\ude4f\n\nI have witnessed the many stages of grief my client has gone through and to see him today laughing, smiling and then to hear him tell me his \u2764\ufe0fhas been cracked open ( in a good way) brings me such joy.\n\nAs your teacher, I will be by your side every step of the journey. Wherever you are at, I will be by your side. \n\nSomething else I\u2019ve experienced personally and with my clients, grief can show up years later. It can show up in the body as dis-ease, that\u2019s what happened to me when I kept my grief in silence. \n\nSometimes we can plan what we think we want to do & life shows us differently. I am following my \u2764\ufe0fand allowing the journey to guide me and take me where I am needed. \n\nThis is just a piece of who I AM, for those of you who only think of me as a cancer survivor. I AM a #cancerthriver giving back to the #cancercommunity.

In fact, it hadn\u2019t even started. I gave up before I even tried because I believed what doctors told me. You will NEVER have your own kids\ud83d\ude2d\n\nThey didn\u2019t mention back than that #surrogacy would be a thing. I think even the doctors were in shock that my little 4 year old body that had 2 years of pelvic/abdominal radiation + surgery were shocked. Not to mention that in college I had a partial #hysterectomy which really made my chances seem impossible.\n\nHere\u2019s the story\u2026\u2026\n\nNothing is impossible.\n\nScience is always changing.

I lost myself and I lost the vision of all my dreams. \n\nI don\u2019t know who is out there listening today, but please hear you\ud83c\udfa4your future free self is waiting for you!!!!! I understand it may be hard to create a vision 1 year from now, or 5 years from now. You may feel stuck in the mud and unable to make any movement. This is a problem because staying stuck will not move you in the direction you say you want to go. \n\nThe question I was asked in this circle was to share TWO words with the group and the leader would write them on the whiteboard in front of the other woman. I was so scared, literally my body was shaking. I was crying and I was afraid to ask for what I wanted and needed. It never crossed my mind that I was allowed to do that\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nSo, I spoke very quietly. \nI said, \u201crespect and love\u201d. \nRokelle the leader said, \u201cI can\u2019t hear you. Say it louder\u201d. I said it again\u2026 respect and love.\n\nLittle did I know at the time, my journey of #personalgrowth would lead me on a path to #selflove #selfcompassion and #selfrespect\u2764\ufe0f\n\nI never saw that coming in my vision.\n\nI only knew what I felt. I didn\u2019t know the solution to my problems. I do today and I am here to pay it forward to help you. \n\nOne of my dreams for my future in the next year is leading my first healing women\u2019s retreat. This time, I will have graduated from the inner circle to the leader. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m here. It feels amazing to stand in my power with confidence. \n\nI want this for you more than you know. The thing is, YOU have to want it for yourself. \n\nDo you want it? \n\nThe journey starts right now by asking and sharing with me here the same question I was asked.\n\nWhat do you want more of in your life. Please answer with TWO words. \n\nIf you catch yourself in the story that you can\u2019t have it \ud83d\uded1 This is an exercise for your mind to CREATE a new vision for yourself.

Straight across me was a quiet man. My husband recognized him from growing up once he took his sunglasses off. I can\u2019t explain the full story here in detail other than it was one of those serendipity moments where you were placed together at the right place at the right time kind of thing. \n\nThe old me would have not striked up conversation. The new me wanted to know more about this person after he handed me his business card telling us about his nonprofit work. My heart was captured.\n\nEvery person has a story, and his story broke my heart and all the other story\u2019s that he was sharing with me. He was diagnosed with stage 4 #coloncancer after his son 18 year old son was diagnosed with cancer. He lost his son to #cancer. I expressed how sorry I was and told him my #childhoodcancer story and it\u2019s as if we are instantly connected. We are both in each others stories.\n\nMy heart \ud83d\udc94breaks even more when he tells me his other son died by #suicide on a drug overdose. I could feel his pain, but in a different way. I can\u2019t say I know what it feels like to lose a child, so I just listened and witnessed his pain, it\u2019s something I learned to do as a #griefeducator with #davidkessler\ud83d\ude4f\n\nOnce I told him I lost my dad to suicide his eyes opened up and there we were, connected through #story. It may seem like a sad story, but in the end like he said, \u201cthere are gifts\u201d.\n\nToday he is SAVING lives of first responders through his nonprofit AT EASE, 911aei.org\n\nThe things he is making happen to inspire other first responders who want to take their life by suicide is in my mind, one of the hardest things, but one of the most important services needed. He was explaining to me the PTSD that first responders live with and most people don\u2019t know. They hold it in and don\u2019t talk about it. \n\nAnyway, my message today is if you are or know anyone who is a first responder feeling thoughts of suicide, there is help for you from trained professionals.

She was my first friend on IG and helped me feel less alone. We finally got to meet when she came to visit me. I\u2019ll never forget that visit. We went to dinner, and she could not eat because she got another bowel obstruction. It\u2019s VERY common with ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer affects a lot more than your ovaries!! Just a few months later, I LOST my friend! I have never cried so hard because it brought reality to my life. What if I am next? I had so many fears of dying.\n\nMy entire life, I\u2019ve fought this fear. I was born with cancer. Crazy right? As a little embryo in my mom\u2019s womb, cancer of my connective tissue started to form, and by the time I was 3 years old, that tumor was the size of a grapefruit, taking over my little abdomen. I truly believe that there needs to be more research on #childhoodcancer!! I read 43 children in the U.S. are diagnosed with cancer every day. Worldwide, about 400,000 children and adolescents develop cancer each year, only half of whom are diagnosed. More than 95% of childhood cancer survivors will have significant chronic health issues or a secondary cancer diagnosis like me\ud83e\udd72\n\nI\u2019ve read that ONLY 4% of all federal funding for cancer research is spent on projects involving children\u2019s cancer\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI share my story to make others aware of the long-term side effects of cancer! I am grateful to be a partner with @larocheposayusa and their cancer squad because they understand cancer care for those of us who have had radiation, #chemotherapy and painful scars from surgery. There are people out there who care and who are making a difference. Until you\u2019ve had cancer, have been touched by cancer or lost a child to cancer, you may not understand the significance of researching for better treatment options and screening tests. Both of my cancers are underfunded, meaning little research goes into them AND I do not have a genetic marker. Where is the research for that? As a cancer survivor, you have so many questions. WHY Me? \n\nThis is MY why.

reminded me of this 8 years ago when I just finished treatment for #ovariancancer\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd17 That means I\u2019ve proven that you can survive ovarian cancer even when the statistics tell you otherwise. \n\nI was so #determined to create a #corerecovery program for #cancersurvivors like myself because getting back to teaching #pilates was hard post #debulking surgery and #ostomy surgery. \u2b06\ufe0f Program in bio\u2b06\ufe0f\n\nFor those of you don\u2019t know what that is, many women with ovarian cancer need a colon bag\ud83d\udca9 because ovarian cancer affects more than your #ovaries. \ud83e\udd8b\n\nAt this point I had an #ileostomyreversal \ud83d\udca9 I can remember spending ALOT of time visualizing my internal tissue around my rectum and colon healing so I could get my reversal. My oncologist told me it wouldn\u2019t happen unless my tissue was healthy.\n\nI spent EVERYDAY doing simple movements that specifically focused on my pelvis, creating blood flow and healing. There was NO manual, so I created my own.\n\nThis program is unique to women recovering from ovarian cancer and #coloncancer.\n\nI understand that not everyone struggles the same, but I do understand your struggle and I am here for you if you need support and guidance from a professional who understands your setbacks.\n\nI share my story to inspire others to never give up!\n\nStory time!!\n\nI had a teacher take my online course and she told me it wasn\u2019t hard enough and that she couldn\u2019t feel the burn\ud83d\udd25\n\nThat is WHY I created this program. It\u2019s not a workout.

It also triggered PTSD in my body. It brought me back to some painful and sad memories. What I\u2019ve learned being trained as a #griefeducator is that #grief comes at different times for people. There is no one way to grieve. \n\nThe #1 form of grief I know I have personally experienced and so have my kids is called #anticipatorygrief. \n\nWhat is anticipatory grief? Grief is often understood to happen after a loss occurs, for example after a loved one dies. People expecting a loss may also experience anticipatory grief. This means experiencing the emotions associated with grief before the expected loss actually happens.\n\nThis photo of Hayden\u2019s body of emotions makes me cry. To see a child watch their mom almost die and to know they felt guilt around it breaks my \ud83d\udc94But look at what this experience has done for us both. It has bonded us in a way I can\u2019t describe. \n\nHayden is able to express his emotions at the age of 20 years old in ways I only wished I could have. This experience has changed him and I already feel it and see it.\n\nWe are taught at a young age to \u201cbe strong\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t cry\u201d, \u201cget over it\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t be sad\u201d. I just want to remind you today that it\u2019s OK to be sad. It\u2019s OK to feel your feelings! You are not alone in what you feel and it\u2019s good to talk about them.\n\nI grew up ashamed of how I felt and if I only had someone who allowed me to feel my feelings and not judge them I know I would have suffered less emotionally. \n\nHayden may not even realize it, but he\u2019s been in training for this. His past experience has helped him through this I believe. \n\nThese are the 5 stages to grief: \ndenial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance\ud83d\ude4f\n\nWhatever you are feeling is normal\u2764\ufe0f\n\nScroll to the picture blown up and you can see when Hayden was 12, his poor little heart felt GUILT. I never want my kids to ever feel any guilt for what has happened to them or me in their life. I just want them to know how much I love them\u2764\ufe0f\n\nI share this post because for 40 years I was sad over the death of my dad when I was 5 and my own cancer diagnosis at age 4.

calls love and support for my boy Hayden.\n\nHe is back home in Santa Barbara. He said the hospital was not good for his mindset and the doctor released him early \ud83d\ude02( it was pretty dark and depressing in there).\n\nHayden had to make some BRAVE decisions. Dr first offered a less extensive surgery keeping the back part of his tibia, but that comes with risks. Higher chance cancer comes back. SO he said, \u201c Hayden, we can GO BIG  and cut more and give you less anxiety about the cancer coming back\u201d. \n\nHayden decided to GO BIG which means a longer recovery. What I didn\u2019t know before surgery was that it isn\u2019t a slam dunk surgery. It will take 4 months of Hayden spending time in his wheelchair and crutches with NO weight at all on his leg before the next scan will determine if the cadaver bone ( dead bone) mates with Hayden\u2019s live bone. Only then, will he begin to slowly start weight bearing and rehab.\n\nIf.. the surgery doesn\u2019t take, Dr said the next surgery is BIG a surgery where they would remove bone from his right leg along with blood vessels to transport to his left leg.\n\nIt\u2019s just so uncertain right now. \n\nIt\u2019s a wait and see but it is 60% chance it will take and the fact that he\u2019s young helps.\n\nHis surgeon came in and told Hayden he is the talk of the town down at UCLA. His tumor is so rare. His bone cancer is so rare and the surgeon said it\u2019s not acting like an Adamantinoma so he felt better going BIG on Hayden\u2019s surgery. \n\nI know Hayden is going to have a LONG recovery ahead of him, but all of your messages and donations that 100% go to Hayden is seriously what\u2019s keeping him going. \n\nHe loves his work and travels as a pro surf photographer. Dr orders, no work, no travel. Rest, rest, rest and no stress which fuels cancer. So Hayden may be out of work easily for a year. I feel so bad for him so I\u2019m trying my best to help him by spreading his go fund me account. \n\nYou can click link in messages or go to Hayden Garfield Cancer Recovery Fund and share this \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\n\nLove you all\nHayden\u2019s mom Emilee", "total_engagement": 15, "engagement_rate": 0.0007052849351137859, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-12-14T21:09:12.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "love", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "messages", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "surgery", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hayden", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "dr", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hospital", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mindset", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "support", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Health", "confidence": 0.7632854580879211}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132522524003, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-17T21:16:35.428Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-17T21:16:35.428Z"}, {"id": 607775132522524002, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "976406434", "created_at": "2023-12-17T21:16:35.400Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-17T21:16:35.400Z"}, {"id": 607775132522704179, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-18T03:30:22.846Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-01T03:33:40.200Z"}, {"id": 607775132522704180, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-12-18T03:30:22.871Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-01T03:33:40.205Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175390140854, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C1uPr0CrQyT/", "post_id": "3273622960659565715", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/a0712f8f5a26a59903bc0eea855ef17c.JPEG", "phash": "a41ecb054fdadcc1", "image_entities": [{"entity": "floor", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8740484118461609}, {"entity": "flooring", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8319542407989502}, {"entity": "furniture", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8041744828224182}, {"entity": "hardwood", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7846482992172241}, {"entity": "leg", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5316469669342041}, {"entity": "swiss ball", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.37192073464393616}, {"entity": "plywood", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.36901652812957764}, {"entity": "room", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.33988356590270996}, {"entity": "standing", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.32745641469955444}, {"entity": "wood", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30145350098609924}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9902359843254089}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6790013313293457}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21864385902881622}, {"entity": "staircase", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20465466380119324}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2045772671699524}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2024-01-17T12:51:17.982Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-21T05:12:06.992Z"}}], "post_text": "You never know how sharing your story will inspire somebody else who is struggling in their current story. \n\nA myth I\u2019d like to clear up is that I ONLY work with clients who have #cancer.\n\nFALSE.\n\nCancer is PART of my story, but it\u2019s not all of my story. \n\nI\u2019ve been teaching in the medical fitness area for about 25 years now. I found a passion for helping individuals who are going through challenging situations and who need a little more TLC, support and guidance.\n\nI started teaching #yoga when I was going through my Iyengar Teacher Training. I was volunteering at a Rehab Hospital and remember working with & being inspired by a young man who was 18 years old, had a spinal cord injury and was told he would never walk again.\n\nI have a BIG \u2764\ufe0ffor helping individuals who want to TRY to exercise and move their body, but who feel like they can\u2019t do it due to their circumstances.\n\nI\u2019ve had my own struggles trying to get back to #pilates with a new #ileostomy and then a #ileostomyreversal so I understand the pain of #scartissue and the after effects that #cancer can carry with us.\n\nThe one thing that we all have in common regardless of our medical situation is the emotional struggle that comes with it. The stories we tell ourselves. The self-doubt, fear etc. well, maybe not everyone, but the clients I work with have all told me they doubted their selves and their abilities after going through a life changing situation. \n\nOne of my \u201cgifts\u201d I was given was to help you or your loved one get through this hard time by helping them both with their emotional & physical body.\n\nI am here for you.\n\nIf you are local and live in #santabarbara I teach inside my medical fitness facility @thetrainingroom_sb \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb if you are not local, I teach by zoom and I\u2019m always looking for the next inspirational story!!\n\nThis image of this leg wind the client of the year award in my eyes\ud83d\udc40\ud83e\udd17 To witness this individual ( who I will keep anonymous) rise above and who has been willing to try hard things and prove their biggest doubts and beliefs wrong has been mind blowing to me.

\n\n\u2705Powerless\n\n I had those same thoughts too\ud83d\ude2d\n\nYou are not alone in your feelings.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I had my BIG wake up call, #cancer that I got the #courage to look inside myself & see where all of these feelings were coming from.\n\nImagine what\u2019s possible for yourself WHEN you change your internal belief system. This is a job that only you can do and I want to be the coach that helps you SO that you can start living a life where you feel resilient, CONFIDENT, committed to yourself & your personal growth.\n\nMy kids told me I would embarrass myself at the age of 40 when I walked into a dance studio after being on #chemo to learn how to dance #latinballroom.\n\nI had to prove them wrong\ud83d\ude02 & prove to myself that I could do anything I put my mind to! \n\nMy main goal was surviving, actually not just surviving because my entire life I\u2019d been living on #survivalmode. \n\nThis time around was my second chance to FEEL joy in life. It was my responsibility to create it & learn how to. I know it\u2019s possible because I did it\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\n\nThe first step is to say YES to yourself!\n\nI\u2019m gifting you a ticket to uncover your top 6 limiting beliefs that probably play like a broken record in your head\ud83e\udd2a AND help you identify the top 6 quantum powers/light qualities that will need to start acting as if so that you can change your belief system. \n\nI was terrified out there on the dance floor competing in my first ever contest. I had a VISION though and a commitment to myself to overcome my self-doubt. When they called my name, Emilee Garfield for 1st place I looked around and thought there was another Emilee. It couldn\u2019t be me, but it was me\ud83e\udd17 \n\nIf I can do it, so can you!\n\nI begin leading the next group journey through a transformational shift in your story & limiting beliefs. Starts Feb 4. If you are READY to change your beliefs & reprogram your thoughts\ud83e\udde0 comment READY and I\u2019ll send you a workbook and recorded mini workshop to get started.
