A lot of those original conversations revolved around us saying our relationship would never work because of our age difference. A lot of those conversations were him telling me he didn\u2019t want to hold me back because I still had so much life left to live, I had so much yet to experience.\n\nEventually though, we decided that if we were happy, if even for a year, if that\u2019s all we shared, it would be worth it.  So we gave in.\n\nOne day after that conversation when we decided to just let it go, we were driving into Savannah. I asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s something you\u2019ve always wanted that you never had?\u201d He said, \u201ca family. Like a real family, who stays together, raises their kids together, loves each other truly, works hard together, has common goals.\u201d I kind of looked at him, taken a back because most men don\u2019t say such deep things.  He continued, \u201cI\u2019d love to have a family with you, but I know I\u2019m probably too much older.\u201d To lighten the mood and give myself a breather from the heavy answer, I said, \u201cyeah, you\u2019re right\u2026you\u2019re too old to get me pregnant anyway,\u201d I said with a side glance and a smile.  James doesn\u2019t like to be told he can\u2019t do something and he immediately challenged it.  So I told him, \u201cI\u2019ll bet you, you can\u2019t.\u201d And it was on from there.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after that bet, he proved to me, he sure could get me pregnant \ud83d\ude02 and 9 months after that, the sweetest little girl arrived who came out looking JUST like him. 8 years later, she still looks just like him. But worse, she acts just like him too \ud83d\ude02 challenging me always, betting me, proving to me and teaching me along the way.  She is the bet I lost, that I\u2019d lose 1000 times over again and and again.\n\nHappy 8th Birthday to our little wild child. The girl who got a brand new outfit to wear from her grandma yesterday when she \u201cgoes somewhere nice\u201d and decided getting to ride in her daddy\u2019s new truck and go fishing was occasion enough.

I was sharing, as I often do, about yet another challenge we were facing. But thanks to all of you and the power in numbers, we, James and Myself and the General Manager, came to a reasonable resolution.  And although we came to a resolution, we will not do business with them again for fear of the same thing happening again.\n\nI took my post down because I\u2019m ready to move forward and I know, the dealership is too.  Time will tell if they uphold their end of the most recent agreement, but I will say with pretty good certainty, they don\u2019t want publicity like what they got over the last almost 24 hours.  I\u2019m hoping that will be enough for them to follow through.\n\nIf you missed the drama, I can promise, if I know anything about life, there will be more drama again some day for me to share.  But for now, we\u2019re moving onward and upward.\n\nFunctioning without a second farm vehicle will be hard, since we sold an older vehicle we had to help make payments toward the vehicle JC Lewis just bought back. But we\u2019ve done harder things before and we will take our time and be choosy about who we work with this time.\n\nI hope in the future though, if I\u2019m posting about a car dealership, it\u2019s because they went above and beyond to work with us and help us so that we can continue to get food to our community in the most ethical ways. I hope some day im posting about a dealership who saw our true value and valued working with us.\n\nThank you all for the support.

She had been drawn in by the PAY WHAT YOU CAN Produce Stand. It was right around Thanksgiving and she asked what meat we had for sale. I told her we had pork, chicken and duck. Her eyes perked right up at the duck. But when I told her how much it was, she said, \u201coh I know it\u2019s worth it and I\u2019d love it. But I can\u2019t afford that. Thank you anyway though.\u201d I told her that if I sold all of the ducks I had for Thanksgiving, I\u2019d save her a duck from our Christmas batch. Sure enough, we sold out and I set a Christmas duck aside for her, on the house.\n\nOver the years we\u2019ve become good neighbors. James used to work on her car when she was having trouble until she was able to get a new car.  Folks would sometimes send us cash for Miss Pat and we\u2019d use it to help pay for the parts her car needed. She would come up to the farm, stop at my office and check on me. And of course, we keep her well fed at the produce stand.  Today we got to catch up at the PAY WHAT YOU CAN Produce Stand when she stopped by before church looking lovely as ever.\n\n Over the years, I\u2019ve cherished building our friendship. And I\u2019m proud to be able to help a neighbor like Miss Pat. She inspires me to keep going with her love, support and gratitude for what we\u2019re doing.\n\nMiss Pat will be the first to tell me, \u201cnow look, I took food but I couldn\u2019t leave anything this time.\u201d I always tell her, it doesn\u2019t matter to me, that\u2019s not what is important to me.  Being able to provide her with real, organic, fresh food is what matters.\n\nMost people stop and I never get to meet them.  But I\u2019m so grateful that the PAY WHAT YOU CAN Produce Stand brought me Miss Pat and its mission has allowed me to continue our friendship of giving over the years.\n\nThe stand is fully stocked today. Please come TAKE WHAT YOU NEED & PAY WHAT YOU CAN. And if you\u2019re able, please leave the suggested price (there is a scale and a price list for most items) or more, if you\u2019re able.

I was talking with investors, potential partners, the bank, financial advisors and agriculture business consultants. I had inspectors go out and look at it with me.  I was so close to doing it. But there was something in me that was still so far away.  Not buying a slaughter facility is probably the best business choice I could\u2019ve made in 2022.  But I still think about it.\n\nIn 2022 we spent just shy of $50,000 in butchering (processing) fees.  Our closest USDA processor that does beef, poultry and pork is 3 hours, one way, away.  That $50,000 doesn\u2019t include the hauling fees paid to our driver, the fuel, the truck maintenance, trailers and repairs on our trailers, it\u2019s just what we pay the butcher.  It doesn\u2019t even include the $5,000 in plastic cages sitting on that trailer each trip.  We sat down and crunched the numbers, many times over. And financially it made sense if we could open our own facility nearby. Remove the hours of hauling fees, fuel & wear and tear, not to mention always get back the product that we are proud to have our label on.  And even if financially, in the long run, it would be better, I still couldn\u2019t commit.\n\nOn a farm tour this weekend, someone asked me what my goals are 5 years from now. They cited my ambition & drive & excitement to see me grow more. I told them, that I was sorry to disappoint but my goal right now is to ride the waves from the storm we\u2019re facing and maybe when the calm hits, bask in it for a moment.  I have no big goals right now, I told them. My goal is to do exactly what we\u2019re doing, but do it better, every time. Not bigger, right now, just better.\n\nIn 2023, better doesn\u2019t look like a slaughter facility for me. We could argue it would be better, in many ways. But the better I\u2019m seeking right now, is better balance.  I want better for myself and my family but better for my staff too.  I want better presence, from me to my family and me to my staff. I want to be a better entrepreneur, leader, wife, mom, neighbor & farmer.\n\n5 years ago this October we started selling publicly. In our first year, we grossed what we do now in a month.  Grown, we have. 2023 we get better at it.", "total_engagement": 2469, "engagement_rate": 0.010496110190026782, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-06T02:24:45.000Z", "brands":

a chicken party!?\n\nFull disclosure\u2026 we\u2019ve lost about 20 chickens in the last 3 days to hawks in broad daylight with a lot of activity around their current section forest.  We started with 700 chickens out in the woods and we\u2019re down to 680.  We have them in an area of woods that has a great open area but it\u2019s proven to be the perfect swooping spot for hawks.  The dogs are hot and hanging in the shade during the day and are only seeing the hawks AFTER the kill.  We\u2019ve raised our chickens like this for almost 4 years now without such staggering losses. We were kind of at a loss as to what to do because even with moving the chickens, we were still afraid the hawk would continue to find them because he was on to them. So we devised another plan. We threw them a party in the woods with balloons and shiny streamers and it\u2019s working!\n\nThe last 24 hours have resulted in no more attacks. And the hawk has been hanging nearby keeping close tabs on things.

We allowed dogs, for years until we finally decided that it just wasn\u2019t worth it any more.\n\nAgritoursim was a huge part of what we did. We had become so busy that we used to employ someone full time just to manage bookings, phone calls, greeting and answering questions and tending to guests.  But when the dogs stopped, so did many of the bookings.  We had been having a lot of other guest issues too. And the dogs, coupled with other guest issues we\u2019d been having, drove us to pull one of our Air BnBs and take a break from another.\n\nBut the only constant is change.  It was scary at first, losing revenue that we had depended on for so long, that we were used to seeing.  We shifted employee responsibilities, adjusted our mindset and kept grinding, focusing on all the things we could control, focusing again, on better, not bigger (it\u2019s my 2023 theme if you haven\u2019t noticed yet).\n\nWith my brain space shifted away from guest issues, I\u2019ve been able to focus more on growing food and providing for our community (our goal all along) and guiding my staff to do just that, to the best of our ability.  And we sure have.\n\nThis summer season so far has been our most productive one yet, cranking out hundreds of pounds of veggies at every harvest, focusing on our livestock, creating new garden spaces and thinning the forests for better Silvopasture sections. We\u2019re not flawless in execution.  Our to do list is still a mile long at the end of every day but we are focused. I am more present for Ellie during the day and in the evenings & I spend more time out in the fields working than putting out fires. And honestly, as much as we loved having a farm filled with guests walking around & learning about what we do, it\u2019s so much more pleasant on the farm without the constant stress of a farm full of guests & their dogs not following directions or heeding warnings.\n\nAgirtourism helped fund our farm, there\u2019s no question about that. But we, along with our staff got us here and will continue forward!\n\nCome to Hilton Head Farmers Market tomorrow from 9am to 1pm and help support our goal, of providing your family with amazing

We\u2019ll also have lots of flowers as well! And of course, pork, chicken, beef AND eggs!  Oh!

I\u2019m so grateful I could go help my family but I\u2019m definitely happy to be home!\n\nPAY WHAT YOU CAN Produce Stand is stocked this morning with the first tomatoes of the season and so much more!\n\nThe produce stand is at the head of the drive to our farm. Anyone and everyone is welcome to stop by and take what they need and pay what they can.  We have this stand to help alleviate food insecurity for our neighbors in Jasper and Beaufort Counties. Everyone should have access to food, but above that, everyone should have access to fresh vegetables raised without the use of pesticides and herbicides, grown in a way that helps enhance the environment instead of taking away from it.\n\nPlease stop by for:\nBasil\nCucumbers\nZucchini\nPatty Pan Squash\nCherry tomatoes\nCompari tomatoes\nItalian eggplant\nOriental eggplant\nEggs\n\nIf you are not someone who faces food insecurity, please consider using the scale we provide to help gauge what the retail price would be and please consider paying retail pricing or slightly over to help those unable to pay. This is a community funded project.

isn\u2019t really the point.\u201d\n\nThe actual goal of the PAY WHAT YOU CAN Produce Stand is to give every person in our community access to real, organically grown food. And that means that sometimes people can\u2019t pay our retail prices but that\u2019s exactly what the stand is for.\n\nMy goal each week has always been to take 10% of our total gross vegetable revenue and put it back on the stand in goods. Sometimes that looks like $40. But sometimes is looks like $400 or more.  We always hope to recuperate the funds for the goods we put out but that is never the goal. We do hope though that those able to pay, use our suggested retail price board and scale to pay retail price or slightly more to help make up for those in our community facing the very real problem of food insecurity.  But this is why we set an attainable goal for ourselves for what we can give back.  We prefer to do it this way instead of donating to a food bank because this is yet another place, another access point for people to get food. And that\u2019s the goal.\n\nThis program only works because we all work together. Myself the farmer, the local community of those able to pay who come out to support, supporters from afar who contribute financially through our website and of course those in our community facing food insecurity.\n\nIf you are a local farmer thinking that this is a great idea for revenue, you\u2019re wrong. But if you are thinking this is a great way to support your community through your work, you\u2019re absolutely right. Set a goal like we have of 10% in veggie sales (or another figure) to go back in goods (remember we have many revenue streams on our farm. So 10% of veggie sales is an attainable goal for us without going broke trying to help). You\u2019ll meet people in your community you never would have without the stand and you\u2019ll be helping so many you would\u2019ve never realized needed help without it.", "total_engagement": 7931, "engagement_rate": 0.03371593759299409, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-25T15:32:45.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "goal", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "question", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "place", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "stand", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "answer", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "farmer", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "idea", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "point", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132059466357, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-03T12:54:21.831Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T12:54:21.831Z"}, {"id": 607775132059466356, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1753937578", "created_at": "2023-08-03T12:54:21.826Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T12:54:21.826Z"}, {"id": 607775132220321732, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T18:26:14.716Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T18:36:44.206Z"}, {"id": 607775132220321733, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T18:26:14.723Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T18:36:44.211Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175224002688, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CuAHAmMNwIW/", "post_id": "3134536167982563862", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/4c36c2bb54de4c906c855a592f02362a.JPEG", "phash": "fac0b53639909af8", "image_entities": [{"entity": "blossom", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9869973659515381}, {"entity": "flower", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9514160752296448}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8914573192596436}, {"entity": "sunflower", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8807417154312134}, {"entity": "plant", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.46905145049095154}, {"entity": "sunflower", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4323740303516388}, {"entity": "flower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.830778956413269}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4395938217639923}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.235582172870636}, {"entity": "flower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22118262946605682}, {"entity": "flower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21464590728282928}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-07-16T15:06:31.121Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-21T05:36:12.790Z"}}], "post_text": "Regenerative farming works by helping all of natures cycles work together!

I try to go through my days pretending looming things aren\u2019t eating away at me, but they are.  I pick in the gardens, thoughts creep in and I find myself talking to myself, practicing what I\u2019ll say.  I cut flowers.  I lay compost. I feed livestock. I sow seeds. It\u2019s all the same, the thoughts darken even the sunniest of days .  Moments where I used to reflect and find myself journaling in my head, so I could publicly journal later are now filled with heart racing anxiety. The longer the time passes, the worse it becomes. And the hardest part for me, I can\u2019t talk about it, even worse, I can\u2019t write about it.

I dreaded the remaining hours in the day.  I thought of how Ellie would want me to hang out and watch her in the pond. Sitting there, watching her, my thoughts taking over, was sure to drive me mad.  To my surprise, I walked out of the office and she was standing there with Willow wanting me to saddle her up.  It was everything I needed, spending time with her, watching her, coaching her.  It gave me quiet and gave me purpose I\u2019d been needing.\n\nAfter a while, she asked to ride bareback so i pulled the saddle off. I dared her to take the bridle off too.  She shimmied up from the fence and on her own, I coached her on how to pull the bridle off while she was still on her horse. She dropped it outside of the rails, smiled at me and said, \u201cand what if I fall?\u201d She already knew the answer, she\u2019d get back up.  But she didn\u2019t fall, she flew.

She actually has a morning chore routine that she completes every day before school work starts!  She usually finishes this chore list before I\u2019ve even come outside for the day.\n\nHer morning chore routine is always feeding her dogs who get the raw chicken dog food we sell from our forest chickens raised right here on the farm, going down and feeding the egg laying hens and rotating her horse to the pasture she\u2019s grazing on for that day.  If we\u2019re not moving the horse, she gives her hay and alfalfa mash for the day. Then she grabs something to eat and starts school work with her tutor who comes to the farm.\n\nAround lunch time she goes back down to the layers and feeds them their lunch. We don\u2019t free feed any of our livestock so the chickens get breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Later in the afternoons she\u2019ll help with whatever odd jobs we need her help with. And at night before bed she always helps with moving her horse back, giving her hay and fresh water and putting the dogs up into the spots they keep watch over, at night.\n\nWe try to have Ellie help with things she enjoys, most of the time. We sure don\u2019t want her to hate living on a farm because she always feels like she\u2019s constantly working. But starting her young with helping, has made it so that at this age, she\u2019s much more prepared to help.

We let her use the skid steer so she can easily put feed into the bucket and bring it down from feed storage and then get it over the fencing without having to drag it over or take fencing down.  Plus what 8 year old doesn\u2019t want an excuse to drive around a skid steer?!\n\nWe don\u2019t free feed our chickens. Instead we feed them breakfast, lunch and dinner to encourage more foraging and movement throughout their rotational sections. We also don\u2019t feed in feeders. We spread feed out in places in the pastures where we want their impact on the soil. They scratch around in different areas, crimping grasses and cover crop and leaving their manure as fertilizer.  Each time we can choose a new area to move them through for their impact.  If there\u2019s a particularly over grown area, we can get it back under control by feeding them over it. If there\u2019s an area we don\u2019t want their impact heavily on, we can avoid it by not feeding over it.

before we even sold our first product.  People would reach out and ask \u201chow we do this and how we do that.\u201d At that time I was already sharing a lot of free content on my social media channels, where if they just dug a little deeper, they most likely find the answer.  Sometimes I\u2019d field the questions in between caring for our own farm which at the time was very small, volunteering at other farms to learn, paying experts for their advice and even working part time at other farms while still holding a full time off farm job. Oh did I mention I was a brand new mom at the time too?  I\u2019d entertain the questions and then eventually get frustrated, feeling like, \u201cI\u2019m out here busting my butt to build my business, paying other people for advice and knowledge and I\u2019m tired of giving all my hard earned experience and knowledge for free.\u201d So I started charging for consultations. The minute I\u2019d share that I offer consultations for a fee, 9/10 times the questions would stop and the person would disappear or worse, bad mouth me publicly for not sharing my knowledge freely (free consumable content apparently wasn\u2019t enough).\n\nAlmost 9 years later from the start and 5 years this fall into growing our Ag business and the trend has never stopped. \u201cWe just bought land and are trying to make it work and be successful, how do you do it?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no secret formula. What works for me, doesn\u2019t work for everyone else. Every ag business is as unique as the land it\u2019s on.  And while it may look like on social media, we are \u201csuccessful,\u201d success in and of itself is different for each person.\n\nBut what I will say is that a team, a strong team who stands behind you and beside you or in front of you when you need it and believes in what you do, will make or break you.

Just today even we transplanted more cucumbers and winter squash!  Tomorrow more zucchini and summer squash are on the list and a bunch of seeds are ready to be started in the greenhouse.\n\nThe next 700 of the 4,000 meat chickens for 2023 move out to forests this week, cows left for breeding and in just a week or so, more pigs go for processing and the next batch of meat chickens will be finished their time on the farm.  And Thursday I head to pick up a new, bigger greenhouse!\n\nEvery day I think about quitting at least once. It\u2019s hot and hard. I can\u2019t imagine what my staff feels, this isn\u2019t even their dream. But we keep pushing through, surviving on lemon lime Gatorade, Body Armor and OUTLAST fruit popsicles.  We don\u2019t keep a seasonal staff, so instead we just stay busy all year round, when lots of other farms take it easier in July and August down here because it\u2019s so hard to grow through the heat.  But each day, the gardens surprise me with their resilience and the livestock use their instincts to cope and the staff uses their sense of humor to make it through.\n\nWe\u2019ll be at the Hilton Head Farmers Market tomorrow from 9am to 1pm at the Coastal Discovery Museum for our monthly stop!  If you believe in supporting those working hard to support others through healthy food access and sustainable practices, come out and shop!  Swipe for the full line up!  And of course, we\u2019re always happily taking donations of electrolytes and popsicles for the team to continue to get us through! \ud83d\ude2c", "total_engagement": 1236, "engagement_rate":

Sometimes when you work out in the heat, day in and day out, you just need a boost and IV hydration therapy was exactly what we needed. These highly skilled ER nurses got us prepped and hooked up and back on our feet and better than ever in no time!\n\nIf you are in the Bluffton, South Carolina area, call Megs Mobile Hydration and tell them the Whippoorwill team sent you!  The team will tell you this is for athletes, folks working outside, or just those that need a boost!  Everyone can benefit!

We all changed the day my dad died over 11 years ago. My relationship with my mom changed.  I grew up and then I watched her grow.\n\nShe\u2019s seen the stretching stages of growth, reaching up and around what was blocking her sunlight, trying to find her light again.  It took her time for her roots to settle into the earth and establish, reaching to the depths for the nutrients, trying to right herself. I\u2019ve seen her storms come, threatening to knock her from what she\u2019d worked to establish. And I\u2019ve watched drought come to suck her spirit dry and snuff her flame.  And I\u2019ve watched moments like this, the truest matriarch, in her element when she\u2019s surrounded by family, feeding her soul.\n\nThere is always beauty in the pain. Her beauty throughout her life and even through her painful childhood has been her journey and her unwavering strength, finding herself again and continuing to work to forgive her past regrets and forge positive experiences for her future.  Her beauty has been growing her relationship with her grandchildren and her grown children. Allowing me to know a woman, I would\u2019ve never realized existed all those years ago, when I fought against her, kicking and screaming, as she fought to keep me alive and fighting the torments of my own mind.\n\nThe older I grow, the more mature I become, the more I see her battle scars. Her battle scars, even the ones that I gave her, especially through my teenage years.  I look back and wonder how we got here, how we survived.  I marvel at a mothers love of their child, that runs deeply through the soul, a constant forgiveness, even forgiveness of the most hateful things I said, a young and immature girl, who thought way back then even, that I knew all the things, had it all figured out.  I marvel at her forgiveness of all the pain she\u2019s seen through her life and her strength to continue after the dust has settled.\n\nThe older I grow, the more I mature I become, the more her love and forgiveness and strength humbled me.

Ruby was a great horse and still lives nearby in GA.\n\nWe sold Ruby back to her original owner when we bought our big farm which was all raw forest without even roads in, no water, electric or anything.

I certainly don\u2019t involve her more than before, she\u2019s always been by my side. I have just learned how to connect to her. The fun mom is my energy shift, connection, the visible care I give now, the worry & instinct toward her I have found.\n\nI\u2019m not ashamed to admit I struggled, isn\u2019t that what life is?  Riding the waves of change, peaks & valleys, acknowledging shifts, forgiving, doing better?  Maybe it\u2019s age, maybe it\u2019s maturity or maybe it\u2019s forgiveness to myself after years of trying to heal from the mental chaos that was my youth and early adulthood.\n\nYou can call me the fun mom, now. Just don\u2019t say it too loud.

This is typical for this time of year. Decreased sunlight (shorter days) and molting season all contribute to this.  Don\u2019t panic. Help your chickens through by increasing protein and probiotics and they will recover more quickly from molting.\n\nAnd if youre a shopper, you will see less eggs at market.  Yes, eggs raised with natures cycles are seasonal. Don\u2019t forget, you can always stock up next year and water glass them or even freeze them to make sure you\u2019re getting nutrient dense eggs through the winter without having to shop at the grocery store. \n\nAs a producer, you can also use artificial lights in your coops to continue to increase daylight. We do not do this however because we feel like with all things in nature, rest and recovery is necessary. It helps our chickens live longer, healthier lives and supports a more natural and seasonal food system that we should all get used to supporting.", "total_engagement": 2264, "engagement_rate":

again.\u00a0 The phone number for the original company had been turned off, emails were bouncing back and there was no way to get in touch.\u00a0 This is a company I have been working with for the last 8 years and had nothing but great experiences with up until today. I was in shock.\n\nI fought as hard as I could with the hatchery, explaining that I paid, a payment the hatchery was never sent apparently, back in July. I paid just shy of $2,000 for the September birds and unfortunately need them for our customers as we will never be able to fulfill our Farm Boxes or have product for market for the beginning of 2024 without those chickens.\u00a0 The hatchery wouldn't budge. They said, if I wanted the chickens, I\u2019d pay again, simple as that. So I forked over the funds, yet again.\u00a0 I've taken all the steps I could so far to try to recover the initial payment but time will tell.\n\nIt's truly always something with running a small business.\u00a0 And often times with farming, it honestly feels harder most days. If it's not mother nature, it's another challenge just waiting in the wings, ready to take you out.\u00a0 So we could truly use the support at market tomorrow and every weekend.\u00a0 Your support at market each week helps us run our business.\u00a0 Your support is the reason why I had emergency funds tucked away.\u00a0 But your support is so much more than that.\n\nYes, you pay an elevated price for our chicken or any of our products than you pay from conventionally raised food.\u00a0 But I can promise you the heart and soul and quality and truth AND nutrients of the product is far beyond anything you could ever get from conventionally raised food.\n\nPlease help us keep the dream alive today, tomorrow, far in to the future.\u00a0 Support us tomorrow at market and support local farms every day.\u00a0 We need our customers, like our customers, need us & the nutritious food we grow and raise for you.", "total_engagement": 1240, "engagement_rate": 0.005271436466437104, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-08-25T23:58:28.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "challenge", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hatchery", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "batch", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "doors", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "company", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hatcheries", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "meat", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132255648020, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-01T11:36:10.266Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-01T11:36:10.266Z"}, {"id": 607775132255648018, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-778467545", "created_at": "2023-09-01T11:36:10.229Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-01T11:36:10.229Z"}, {"id": 607775132255714916, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-01T12:38:57.043Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T18:36:45.018Z"}, {"id": 607775132255714917, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-09-01T12:38:57.051Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T18:36:45.024Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175250895668, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cwc9ffcuELR/", "post_id": "3178685881925518033", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/04849a757e5febf1901b76984ed2ab7d.JPEG", "phash": "d9be5221c195fa1a", "image_entities": [{"entity": "natural foods", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2501346468925476}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.33873823285102844}, {"entity": "tableware", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.30537766218185425}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20469574630260468}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-08-31T08:19:13.353Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-21T05:46:16.177Z"}}], "post_text": "Today is Sunday, August 27th and the PAY WHAT YOU CAN Produce Stand at the head of the drive to the farm is stocked!\n\nThis stand is here so that EVERYONE has access to real organically grown food.

farming.  5 years into business, 2023 has been the year where we have really dug in deeply to the roots that began all of this, feeding our community and we truly have been doing just that.  It\u2019s also been the year I\u2019ve seen the most challenges.  Financial challenges, staffing challenges, challenges with guests visiting the farm, weather challenges, the list goes on and on.  But through all of those challenges, this team right here (missing Ryan and Tatiana) continued to push through.\u2028\nEach person on our team has their own special reasons they want to be here, and those reasons are uniquely special to who they are as people.  Our team has the most unique crew, all different walks of life, at all stages in their lives, but we all share a common goal of having a career that makes a difference in our world, some how.\n\nAlthough 2023 has been hard for me as a business owner, this team has made running the daily operations of the farm a breeze.  Always willing to step up, go above and beyond, stay late or come in early and continue to push through the sweltering, unforgiving summer that we faced.\n\nBecause of this team we accomplished so much.  Some of those accomplishments include having our best year so far with our vegetable production, providing to many local restaurants on a weekly basis AND having a strong Saturday Farmer\u2019s Market selection almost every Saturday so far this year.  We\u2019ve expanded our Lowcountry Farm Box subscriber list to more than we\u2019ve ever been able to service, with the team stepping up to prepare orders, pick and prep and deliver boxes on schedule with minimal hiccups every week.  We have been able to stock the PAY WHAT YOU CAN Produce Stand with more meat, eggs and veggies than ever before helping EVERY ONE in our community have access to organically grown food.  And our livestock health has been better than ever as their consistent attention to detail and care shines through each day making sure problems are addressed immediately.\n\nThank you, Team, for an amazing 2023 so far and looking forward to much success and accomplishments in the future.  Cheers to cooler days ahead!", "total_engagement": 1158, "engagement_rate": 0.004922841474301747, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-08-28T13:12:26.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [],

Everyone\u2019s situation is different, everyone\u2019s farm is different. But years of farming through hurricanes have our prepping down to a science that works for us.  And a reel cannot possibly cover everything we do to prep our livestock, but here is a snapshot.  Currently on farm we\u2019re prepping for about 2,000 chickens, 150 pigs, livestock dogs, cattle and gardens, plus infrastructure prep.  Our farm is 20 miles inland from the coast between Savannah GA and Charleston SC. \n\nThe egg chicken\u2019s coops doors will be left open through the storm and the night. This allows them the ability to escape safely if wind or rain threaten the safety of their coop. They will always come back if they have to leave their coops for safety.  We would never want a tree to fall on them and them be trapped or the coop to blow over if it gets that bad and them be stuck inside.\n\nMeat chickens are kept in high elevation wooded areas with lots of low branches for roosting to escape flooding or brush they can huddle under for safety.  Chicks in the brooder have stayed in longer than normal to protect them from the storm.\n\nCattle are released from small rotational grazing sections to allow them more space to run away if scared or seeking shelters. \n\nHalters and collars are removed to prevent hang ups on fencing or debris if there is danger causing them to flee.  Instead, small ID tags are braided into tails and manes.\n\nWater is pumped from our irrigation pond into holding totes in case generators are occupied and we need water fast.\n\nAll livestock are given access to double the amount of feed and water they normally would have. If we have to put our energy into infrastructure issues, we know what we\u2019ve provided can keep them happy and their bellies full for at least 24 hours.\n\nThe pigs who usually get MUCH LESS feed are spoiled during storms to keep them away from getting mischievous and testing fencing that may be down.  They\u2019ll still forage, but they\u2019ll also still be naughty too.

Our chickens will have the option of staying in or going out and it will be better if we can just be sure their coops are stable through 100mph wind gusts.\n\nWe use totes that we typically pick up bulk grains in or distillers or brewers grain.

I had been pushing her, I\u2019ll admit it. It\u2019s because she\u2019s been talking about showing and barrel racing and even though I don\u2019t have the budget for it now, someday I might. So I\u2019ve been trying to help her see there is so much more to riding than hanging on and keeping your hands and heels down so when we can, she\u2019s ready.\n\n\u201cThis is just so hard and it\u2019s so frustrating.\u201d I don\u2019t want it to be like that for her to where it makes her not enjoy it. But this is an Ellie pattern. She was the same with brushing her hair when she was little and then again learning to read and all the little things in between. When things are hard or annoying or aren\u2019t happening after the first try, she declares she hates it & quits.  I told her, \u201cbe up there for you.  If it\u2019s not what you want, get down, I\u2019m fine with it. You can go back to just trail riding, we don\u2019t have to work towards more.\u201d She refused to dismount.\n\nSo I asked her how often she thought I wanted to sell the farm. Her response was, \u201cyou don\u2019t.\u201d I said \u201cwrong.\u201d Truth is, every day I  think about selling the farm. Not all day every day but every day. When my husband leaves for work at 430am, gets home after dark and then helps me into the late evening still, I want to quit.  When markets are slow and money is tight, I want to quit. When Mother Nature throws us constant curve balls, I want to quit. When I watch everyone around me taking vacations with their families, I want to quit.\n\nBut I don\u2019t. We don\u2019t.  And it\u2019s for moments like this, the moments she\u2019ll carry with her. The moments of resilience we teach her and the moments of resilience she experiences. The memory of building a bond with her horse and breaking bad habits and working through hard times and succeeding. She\u2019ll carry this.  The times she\u2019s watch us scratch and claw to stay standing on this farm, through seemingly impossible times, she\u2019ll carry that.  It\u2019s the teachable moments scattered throughout her childhood, that in her darkest moments in life, those memories of resilience will carry her through.\n\nShe wiped her eyes & the lesson carried her through.", "total_engagement": 1448, "engagement_rate": 0.006155677422097522, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-09-03T11:32:58.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132296820550, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-15T15:25:58.406Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T15:25:58.406Z"}, {"id": 607775132296820549, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1781662518", "created_at": "2023-09-15T15:25:58.403Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T15:25:58.403Z"}, {"id": 607775132300766117, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-16T12:43:50.720Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T18:36:45.181Z"}, {"id": 607775132300766118, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-09-16T12:43:50.725Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T18:36:45.186Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175272463721, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cw2Z36YODLI/", "post_id": "3185847579828564680", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/9708f749dae78935c55a3d53e0e89c4e.JPEG", "phash": "ab175821976af4d2", "image_entities": [{"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7137580513954163}, {"entity": "book cover", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6901853680610657}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5379622578620911}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4110674262046814}, {"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7744152545928955}, {"entity": "gate", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.30511173605918884}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-09-13T09:48:25.439Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-21T05:50:24.211Z"}}], "post_text": "One of the most requested videos I get asked to make is videos of our infrastructure because we use all shipping containers for every out building on the farm from our tools to feed storage to our brooder to walk ins and more.

But I also thought about how in my previous relationships, I would make excuses for the horrible and at times physical fights we would have. I would excuse the men I was in relationships with, when they would say horrible things about my body and I\u2019d tell myself \u201cthey just want me to be the best version of myself.\u201d I thought if we had money, a nice home and a few happy moments scattered throughout that I was supposed to be grateful for that.

He was thoughtful, always considering my wants and needs, even just as friends.  He made it nearly impossible not to like him. When he was my neighbor, I\u2019d wake up in the morning and I\u2019d find vegetables from his garden, on the hood of my car for me for the day.

Then he\u2019d sit on the back of his truck with his tailgate down and a Coors Light in his hand and watch me work that colt.\n\nTruth is, I never got to be myself until I met him. At least be myself, alongside of someone else. When those other relationships would end, I\u2019d reclaim my independence, then and only then, being the best version of myself, the one I thought I had to change to appease all the others. Eventually a new one would come along and I\u2019d conform again as they snuffed my flame.  It was a miserable cycle.

If you had told me, sitting on milk crates on the deck, with this wide eyed baby girl with a half plucked chicken on her lap looking on, helping us get our own food on the table, that someday we\u2019d be raising 4,000 chickens per year to feed our local community, I wouldn\u2019t have believed you.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget when he finished my washing machine chicken plucker, not long after processing our first chickens by hand. I went down from 15 minutes plucking to 15 seconds. Only downfall was if you touched the washing machine when it was on, you got shocked.  And the day I had my own processing station with makeshift tables, I would\u2019ve told you I hit the lottery.\n\nIt has been a constant evolution of growth, mostly outgrowing. Outgrowing those makeshift tables for a stainless work station, then a covered work space, eventually upgrading to cement floors and two completely different pack and wash sheds, one for poultry and one for veggies.  And it\u2019s not just he and I and that wide eyed baby girl any more. It\u2019s a team of us, that work tirelessly, day in and day out to feed our community. And luckily I traded that washing machine for a commercial plucker years ago.\n\nI remember feeling like we\u2019d never make it, we\u2019d never have the things we needed.  I remember almost quitting, 1000 times.\n\nI hate to tell you that it never gets easier \u201cmaking it\u201d. You\u2019re still going to want to quit.  I still almost do.

That means that we know the origin of our pork and how it was raised and treated with 100% certainty from start to finish. We have been working since 2015, growing our breeding program and our pork program. Our pigs are raised naturally in the woods and rotated through forest sections. They forage on roots and tubers, bugs, grubs and different foliage. They are an incredibly important part of helping us thin our forest canopy to create silvopasture, as they uproot saplings and even invasive species like kudzu vines and chinaberry trees. \n\nWe farrow pigs 1-2 times per year between April and October when the weather is best for natural, outdoor farrowing. Our sows farrow fairly unassisted, with us helping to make sure their nests have enough hay, the piglets aren\u2019t getting tangled with their long umbilical cords and that they are all nursing by the time the sow is finished farrowing.\n\nTo control our populations, bloodlines and inbreeding we castrate our males at birth. This is least traumatic for the sow, as she\u2019s still in a trance from the birth that she doesn\u2019t even realize the piglets have left. Sows are INCREDIBLY protective of their piglets and can get VERY VERY upset when you take their pigs. The piglets also have very tiny testicles which lead to tiny incisions which heal quickly.  The constant access to colostrum after also helps the pigs heal more quickly than if we waited.\n\nWe do not vaccinate our pigs for anything and we will watch for parasites as the weeks go by, individually treating and not blanket treating so that we can continue to encourage strong, hearty bloodlines that thrive in forest environments with minimal human intervention.\n\nOur bloodlines are hybrid sows that we\u2019ve developed over the years that include Duroc, Yorkshire, Berkshire, and Mangalista.

We were all excited, especially Ellie. Just like with everything else, I included her, along in the pregnancy journey.  She\u2019d lay on my belly every night and press her ear to my belly.  We\u2019d talk about how big the baby was and she\u2019d ask how many sleeps until the baby would be here.\n\nWhen I had Ellie I spent years battling the postpartum depression that ensued. Finally, when Ellie was about 3, I felt good enough and felt ready enough to welcome another baby. I have a sister I love dearly, I wanted Ellie to have a sibling too. We also felt like 4 would complete us.  So we tried again. And pretty soon after, we had baby number 2 on the way.\n\nThat was the plan until it wasn\u2019t any more. No one knows why these things happen.\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last almost four years, every single month, wondering if I\u2019m pregnant when my cycle comes around.  I\u2019ve probably spent hundreds of dollars on pregnancy tests in the last 4 years, thinking each time I\u2019m slightly late, will be the month.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve accepted though is that there\u2019s a greater plan and I\u2019ve learned over the years to understand that I\u2019m good with this plan, whatever it is. But it doesn\u2019t stop me from wondering what could\u2019ve been or what might be.\n\nWhat I do believe though, is that this is how it was always meant to be.  I was meant to have this wild girl. And then I was meant to have the pain and the sadness. But my wild one, was always meant to keep me grounded to bring me back to all things real and true.  She\u2019s the one I find bridleless and bareback, flying with her horse in the setting sun.  She completed me long ago, allowing me to share a part of who I am, along with all that she is.\n\nI think about that little baby girl leading that horse all those years ago. I think about watching Ellie grow into the little rider she is now and how that little baby she was, is so very long gone. Every day. I think about the one we lost too.

Well, the first time we sold it legally. Back when we started years ago, we didn\u2019t know what we didn\u2019t know. Hell, the custom butcher we used didn\u2019t even put the \u201cnot for sale\u201d sticker on our meat.  We learned one day though when someone from the department of ag came and ran their own little sting operation on my poor hubby who had nothing to do with anything farm really.\n\nI was at work and James was home before me and this guy from the department of ag stopped by our old farm. Posing as a hardcore home grown pork lover, he insisted on buying some pork. He said he saw on Facebook we had some for sale. James actually tried to give him a pack of chops to just try since I wasn\u2019t home and he couldn\u2019t get ahold of me. But the guy who we later learned was an inspector insisted on handing James a $5 bill. And as soon as James took the $5, the truth came out.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have a livestock trailer back then to haul our pigs to the USDA, we barely had a pot to piss in.  So we offered our next batch as Whole Custom Cut Hogs and used that money to invest in a trailer. Since those first whole hogs, we haven\u2019t offered them again. That is until now.\n\nOver the years we have built our pork program up from 10 pigs to harvest per year to almost 100. And we sell all of our pork direct to consumer in retail cuts locally. But this fall, we just happen to have 10 extra hogs that are ready and just not enough freezer space because we raise a years worth of chicken just in the summer months and the walk in is slammed full of beef, pork and chicken.\n\nSo for the first time since 2018, we\u2019re offering Whole Custom Cut Hogs. If this is something you have asked us about, now is your chance. 2 have already sold, bringing us down to 8 remaining. We\u2019ll be offering them to our email list subscribers first to snatch up.  This available as on farm pick up OR Roebling, NJ pick up (for when I visit my mama later this fall).\n\nIf this is something you want, send us a DM with your email so we can make sure you\u2019re on our email list so you can know first!

I told him, \u201cThe bank takes back the land.\u201d He seemed unfazed by that possibility.  So I went with it.  I knew, after selling our first farm, we had just enough money left over to make the first 3 land payments.  We had three months to figure out where the money was going to come from.  James and I could only work so many hours at our off farm jobs and there was only so much we could do.  So we put our heads down and we worked.\n\nFor the last 4 years, we did all the things that a lot of people said we couldn\u2019t do.  We did a lot of the things, even I didn\u2019t think would be possible.  Now we gross, during good weeks, what we grossed in our first year, back on our first farm 5 years ago.\n\nThe stress, the worry, the struggle has never once dissipated.  In fact, all of those things have gotten bigger with every investment we make toward continuing this dream.  I look back at that short video clip in the beginning, when all this land was, was a big dirt pit, I can\u2019t help but be amazed at us, my husband, myself, my daughter, our team.  4 years isn\u2019t really that long at all, but in 4 years so very much has changed.\n\nMost of all, I have changed. I have grown. And every day that I spend on this land, I get closer to figuring out exactly what I was meant to be doing. I haven\u2019t found it quite yet. This isn\u2019t the end game for me, farming. I have so many other gifts to share with the world. But what farming has done, what building this business has done, is allowed me to dig in deep. Dig deeply into who I am as a person. Farming has exposed my greatest flaws, faults and weaknesses. But in return, farming has exposed my greatest strengths too.

The before and afters of so much that I silently envisioned.  James didn\u2019t even see it in the beginning. I couldn\u2019t explain to him what I saw that day we walked the property. \u201cThere\u2019s no pastures. There\u2019s not even any roads.  Whatchu gonna do with all these woods?\u201d \u201cFarm it,\u201d I told him. \n\nAnd farm it, we have. Doing it completely different than anyone that walked this land ever has.  Finding the solutions when all that stood in front of us was difficulties.  Difficulties we faced, challenges we overcame.  I built the business as James chipped away at the endless to do\u2019s on any and every one of his days off over the last 4 years.\n\nEach of these before and after photos were taken standing the exact same place.  And although I envisioned the after, I could have never imagined the journey in between and how hard it\u2019s been. But I never take the easy way out, my mom would attest to it and my dad watching down on me would agree.  There\u2019s no room to follow game trails in my world, I was out here to forge new paths.  And I just so happened to find a partner in all of this that knows how to help me forge through when I feel trapped or stuck.\n\nTonight James told me we had just over a year left to pay on one of our loans we took out to build some of the early infrastructure on the farm. \u201cWe\u2019re getting so close. I\u2019ll just keep pushing and trying to make it happen.\u201d His response, \u201cyou are making it happen.\u201d\n\nWe all are making it happen. Including our loyal customers, like our Lowcountry Farm Box Subscribers, our weekly market shoppers, our restaurant partners, the guests who come and stay on the farm, our donors of the PAY WHAT YOU CAN Produce Stand and the avid learners who sign up for my virtual and in person classes.  We appreciate all of you so much and every single one of you, helps us get closer to \u201cmaking it happen,\u201d every single day.\n\nWe\u2019ll see you at the Forsyth Farmers Market tomorrow in Savannah!

When we took over these pasture 2 years ago, they had been bush hogged for the last 10 years, with no other inputs or livestock impacts.  Much of the soil was bare, with very little organic matter.\n\nOver the last three years we have tirelessly rotated our cows and our egg chickens, cover cropped, rolled out round bales of hay, given the pastures plenty of time off and repeated the cycle again and again.  After two years time, we are finally seeing huge amounts of organic matter in the pastures and beautiful grasses that grow to maturity quickly.  We\u2019ve also noticed that the soil temperature in these pastures has decreased over the years as the dense grasses and added humus have helped to cool the soil, holding moisture in, even during the 105 degree, dry summer months.\n\nOur pastures thrive and grow during the most difficult of climate conditions.  Through heat and drought they continue to grow and thrive to keep our livestock fed.  Through torrential rain, the well established root systems and grasses soak up the moisture, preventing run off and absorbing that water like a sponge.\n\nOur farm is so much more than feeding livestock to in turn feed you.

He was quiet and stood in my kitchen while I cooked dinner.\u00a0 I honestly felt like he didn't want to be here at the farm, anywhere near Ridgeland and especially not in my kitchen trying to convince me that he wanted to volunteer.\n\nMike had been struggling for some time.\u00a0 He finally decided, if he was going to get on track, giving his mom a chance to help him line some things up, would be one of the best ways to help him get back on his feet.\u00a0 I reluctantly agreed, a little nervous that I'd spend my time teaching him and one day, he'd be gone.\u00a0 After a month of hard volunteering, I told mike if he was ready, I would hire him full time.\n\nThe week after he earned his first paycheck, I was sure he wasn't going to show up for work.\u00a0 But he was there, rain or shine, never late, on his bicycle pulling up the driveway.\u00a0 Mike and I spent a lot of time together in his first few months on the farm.\u00a0 I'll never forget, in one of our hard labor days together he said, \"Yeah, I just have no idea who would want to work outside all day long, every single day.\"\u00a0 I looked over and waved, \"Hey!\u00a0 It's me.\u00a0 I do.\"\u00a0 We both got a good laugh.\u00a0 As I got to know him more, I really started to look forward to seeing him on the farm.\u00a0 And Ellie and James did too.\u00a0 Mike can talk to anyone about anything.\u00a0 And he's always joking and kidding around.\n\nAs Mike continued to work hard and save up, he bought a truck from James and I.\u00a0 It was the truck that Ellie had learned to drive in.\u00a0 Jokingly, as he often did with Ellie, he asked her to move his truck.\u00a0 I was out in the garden, and I looked up and saw his truck moving with no driver in sight and started to panic.\u00a0 Finally I saw the littlest farm girl with a shit eating grin looking over as she pulled by.\u00a0 We all got a big laugh that day.\n\nWe're so happy to have Mike apart of our farm family.\u00a0 It's been an honor and a pleasure to watch him grow with us for the past year and I look forward to working outside with him, in all kinds of weather for years to come! \ud83d\ude2c", "total_engagement": 1854,

Forest Chickens Online Class has been a great success, filled with folks interested in thinking outside of the box (or chicken tractor) when it comes to raising meat for themselves or scaling their operation in areas with difficult terrain or little to no pasture space.\n\nAs a farm that raises 4,000 chickens per year in the forest without coops and sells locally only, without shipping, direct to consumer, we know a thing or two about raising, processing and successfully marketing our poultry products.\n\nIn the past 2 classes we\u2019ve talked about chick and breed selections, brooding, forest transitions, predator prevention and so much more!  This week we\u2019re covering ALL THINGS PROCESSING!  From forest collection in large batches to humane dispatching, cleaning and plucking, we\u2019ve got you covered. Well go over whole birds and cutting them down. And we\u2019ll show you our entire set up. We\u2019ll also discuss labels and regulations as well!\n\nIf this is something you\u2019ve been wanting to learn, you don\u2019t want to miss this class. It will be a mix of pre recorder material and LIVE teaching to give you the most opportunities to ask questions and set yourself up for success!\n\nSign up for the full series and we\u2019ll send you the recorded classes you missed!

6,000 of the 10,000 sweet onions we\u2019ll plant this season in the ground!\n\nI remember when I thought 100 onions would be PLENNTYYY.  Then I remember last year when we thought 5,000 would be more then enough.  I haven\u2019t been right once!  This year we\u2019re doing 10,000.  Honestly if it wasn\u2019t for row space in our no till gardens, we\u2019d do more. But this will be good for this year until we expand again.\n\nMost of these will be harvested before the bulbs are very big in size in early 2024 for our restaurant clients as Spring Onions.  As we grow them and harvest the Spring Onions, it will naturally thin them, allowing the onions that were closer in proximity to bulb out.\n\nWe practice the same method with our root vegetables, planting more densely and then thinning as smaller bulbs and allowing others to grow and expand a little longer. This not only saves space, but allows us to offer multiple finishes from the same planting and veggie.\n\nIt\u2019s an awful labor intensive job but luckily, not every day looks like this on the farm.  We\u2019ve got 4,000 more to go in the ground tmrw and then a few hundred of each broccoli, collard and Swiss chard but the big planting for fall is almost over. Soon we\u2019ll be just maintaining with weekly direct seeding and a few hundred plants per week as seedlings.\n\nI\u2019m so proud of our team we\u2019ve got right now.  The ones pictured, mentioned and even those not in this post.  We\u2019ve all been incredibly busy making sure the community is fed!\n\nCheck tomorrow for veg on the PAY WHAT YOU CAN Stand for some veggies!

I actually met my husband as his neighbor living in an RV park.  There are lots of reasons to love small, minimalistic living.  But with each perk, has come lots of sacrifices as well.  Small space living, long term, is not for the faint of heart and over the years, the lack of a kitchen with elbow room has slowly worn on me.  I\u2019ve struggled to cook in the RV for years, especially cooking from scratch.  The busy schedule of running the farm, James working full time, no space to spread out and cook and an unreliable oven and a stove with just a couple burners has really turned me off from cooking.  It is hard to start meals during the day, when I am covered in chicken and pig poop, traipsing in and out of the RV to check things, turn things, baste things AND try to remember I was cooking in the first place.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, James took an old stove and microwave someone was throwing out and he installed it, in our meat processing area!\n\nMy goal since then, has been to try to cook at least dinner each day using only veggies and meats from the farm.  My goal has also been to focus those dinners on all the things that my customers always struggle with cooking.  As someone who hasn\u2019t really cooked for the last 10 years, or as an actual grown up (I was in my early 20\u2019s when I moved into an RV!), if I can cook, anyone can.\n\nSo this past week, I roasted my first whole chicken ever, in my whole life.  A chicken I raised myself and then harvested, plucked by hand and processed for a class I am teaching.  It came out PERFECTLY.  Today, I baked our chicken wings.  I made them for all the staff working and everyone raved about them.  I even made scratch ranch dressing for dipping them.\n\nSomeday I dream of having a small house.  Nothing crazy, maybe 1,000 square feet.  But until then, I\u2019ll continue manifesting, we\u2019ll continue saving money for it and I\u2019ll continue to perfect my cooking, in this very forgiving, outdoor space where I can be as messy as a beginner cook needs to be!\n\n*recipes in comments!*", "total_engagement": 3113, "engagement_rate": 0.013233856225821536, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-10-20T19:19:34.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "neighbor", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "someone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "space", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "husband", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goal", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sacrifices", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rv", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lack", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "term", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lots", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rv park", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reasons", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "perk", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "living", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "james", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132408988115, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-30T12:07:50.849Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-30T12:07:50.849Z"}, {"id": 607775132408988114, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-393152472", "created_at": "2023-10-30T12:07:50.840Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-30T12:07:50.840Z"}, {"id": 607775132409042444, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-30T13:05:30.119Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T18:36:45.799Z"}, {"id": 607775132409042445, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-10-30T13:05:30.145Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T18:36:45.805Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175319374182, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CyrroYnNSQ7/", "post_id": "3218858249892996155", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/f2c1286d3a71ab6025a3c7870f3f998c.JPEG", "phash": "e079403e3f243e8f", "image_entities": [{"entity": "botany", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7277008295059204}, {"entity": "plant", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3296568691730499}, {"entity": "smile", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24597612023353577}, {"entity": "scarf", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6444272994995117}, {"entity": "sweater", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4489895701408386}, {"entity": "vase", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3300088942050934}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.29496508836746216}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-10-31T02:57:24.457Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-21T06:04:46.153Z"}}], "post_text": "As the seemingly never ending summer has faded behind us, in a year that has felt, it was filled with nothing but challenges, I look around at the farm in the setting sun and can\u2019t help but be proud of all we\u2019ve achieved this past season.\n\nThe summer weeds we thought we\u2019d never tame have given way to beautiful fall crops on our no till farm. The forests and silvopastures are filled with the last 1,400 chickens we\u2019ll raise for meat for 2023.  Our last farrowings of 2023 pulled us well over our goal for our 2024 pork program.\n\n4 years ago we moved here, to absolutely nothing but dense woods. No roads, no water, no electric, no anything. And for 4 years we have hustled to build this place.  So much of what we struggled with in the beginning comes wildly easy now. And what we thought was a challenge back then is nothing compared to what the universe throws at us these days. As our farm and business become more complex, larger and mature, so do the types of problems we encounter.  But regardless we push through.\n\n3 of the 4 garden spaces are tamed and nearly all completely planted for fall, with rows in continual production, harvest and flipping for weekly direct seeding. The longer growing crops are in the ground with successions that followed and more on the way.  The 4th garden is mostly covered and resting, with a few rows peeking through. Our high tunnel is still giving us tomatoes from plants that went in all the way back in May.  And in between the tomatoes, the arugula has been a chef and customer favorite.\n\nAfter almost 4 years as no till, bringing no equipment in to break up the soil, the oldest of the gardens (photo 5) struts her stuff as the younger of the gardens still gain their footing in their no till journey.  We\u2019ll still work to lay cardboard, combat high weed pressure and soil inconsistency in the younger gardens. But over time, they will find their way too.\n\nCan\u2019t say I\u2019m sad to start to bid farewell to 2023.  But I\u2019ve learned this year that it\u2019s ok to be ready to say goodbye to things but also recognize how those very things have shaped you along the way.  Love and hate can both coexist.

Profitable to who?  The backyard gardener?  A commercial farmer with payroll to fill?\n\nThe question I think most people are asking is, \u201ccan you afford to full time farm and support your family and employees by just stocking the PAY WHAT YOU CAN Produce Stand?\u201d\n\nThe answer to that would be a hard NO.\n\nBut we work insanely hard to make sure that we are at least somewhat profitable (for a farm) in all of our other revenue streams. Those include our Subscription Service which functions similar to a CSA, restaurant sales weekly, multiple farmers markets, agritourism, consultations and online classes and speaking engagements as well as online monetization and sponsorship.  We also have mutual aid shares that help fund the PAY WHAT YOU CAN Produce Stand and donations as well which greatly contribute to its success.  Through all of that hard work, the PAY WHAT YOU CAN Produce Stand is able to exist. The money we get at the stand rarely covers the cost of the food we put out, but it\u2019s not about that really and that\u2019s what\u2019s important for folks to take away.  The stand is apart of the farm ecosystem and it only functions properly when all the other parts of the farm are functioning properly too.

We use grazing lanes to focus them in small areas to move from space to space and back to their home base.\n\nOne more week for these Freedom Rangers and then they\u2019ll head to our USDA processor and their silvopastures and forest will go on rest after a fresh broadcast seeding of fall cover crops!\n\nThe next time this area will see livestock will be months from now in the spring!",

We use grazing lanes to focus them in small areas to move from space to space and back to their home base.\n\nHere the chickens are heading past the garden to their home base for the night after being in the silvopasture through the afternoon.", "total_engagement": 902, "engagement_rate": 0.0038345449134889256, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-03T01:04:08.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "forest", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "chickens", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "group", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sections", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "groups", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "needs", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "home", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "spaces", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "meat", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132441333581, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-10T22:16:58.157Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-10T22:16:58.157Z"}, {"id": 607775132441333580, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1000130258", "created_at": "2023-11-10T22:16:58.152Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-10T22:16:58.152Z"}, {"id": 607775132443241697, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-11T18:33:02.429Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T18:36:46.014Z"}, {"id": 607775132443241698, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-11-11T18:33:02.447Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T18:36:46.020Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175332438981, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CzTVlDOO_li/", "post_id": "3230020262812186978", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/a26eacdb078ce6fa825702fc397a0e42.JPEG", "phash": "bcfc050cf4264ef1", "image_entities": [{"entity": "water", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20788493752479553}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8223533034324646}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.615229070186615}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5672767162322998}, {"entity": "bird", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2780322730541229}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2533816993236542}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-11-11T03:06:33.856Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-21T06:06:19.853Z"}}], "post_text": "This Thanksgiving, make it a point to know where your food comes from.\n\nAlthough we don\u2019t raise turkeys, we love being able to help support others that do, through helping process and giving referrals.

I never give out my personal number but I was feeling adventurous so I answered.  The caller said, \u201cI have your number here on a piece of paper from last week some time and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s important but I can\u2019t remember why.\u201d\n\nEventually after a few minutes he remembered why. A colleague of mine had shared my number with him. He was a fellow SC farmer who raises pigs and as of lately, he\u2019s been feeling the strain of the economy more than usual.  I immediately was interested in talking to him.\n\nI find it hard to connect with many of my colleagues.  They flood their social media with \u201clook how great all of this is and how wonderful our farm is!\u201d But no one ever talks about the struggles, especially the financial struggles. No one ever says, \u201csales are down and I\u2019m worried about paying my feed bill.\u201d No one ever outwardly says, \u201cwe don\u2019t make enough money to eat the food we raise.\u201d No one ever admits, \u201cthis is harder than we thought it would be.\u201d And even in person, for some reason, I seek connection and true meaningful conversation but it\u2019s often surface level & it leaves me feeling like I must be missing something if we have struggles.\n\nBut I know it\u2019s not true because I\u2019m far too bright and business minded to be the only who struggles at times. And whether it sounds arrogant or not, if I haven\u2019t financially found the secret with farming, no one has.\n\nBut there was something so refreshing today, getting a call from a complete stranger and them saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know that things have ever been this tight financially.\u201d I immediately felt all of what they were saying so deep within my soul.  30 minutes of honest conversation later, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t catch your name.\u201d But it didn\u2019t really matter his name or his farm name or where he lived or what markets he sold at.

I was hunting for our camping gear. It had been 6 years since we used it last. 6 years almost to the date when we took our last camping trip. The last trip happened right before the goal of raising food for ourselves really started to shape into reality. A year after that, things morphed into raising food for others and our new reality of quitting my corporate career, working part time and full time farming set in. But that reality meant we really couldn\u2019t afford the food we were raising and we definitely couldn\u2019t get away.\n\nSince then we\u2019ve kept our heads down and hustled. James still works his off farm job and I not only am not working part time outside of the farm, but we\u2019ve built a business that is run and managed, no longer just by myself but by a team of people we built and continue to develop.\n\nAnd although the stresses of the business and the financial strain continue to be ever present, we continue to steal back moments for us.  What we\u2019ve built, including our team, are giving us these moments back that we\u2019ve worked so hard for, for so very many years.\n\nNothing extravagant for this farming family. Just a primitive camp site an hour from home, fishing poles and piles of fire wood. But these days, when we cook over flame, it\u2019s our proteins we\u2019re grilling, our eggs we\u2019re eating, our veggies we\u2019re slicing. And although we might still eat the less popular and cheaper cuts, we finally can afford to.  And we can also can afford to step away. If even for just a couple of nights, a stone throw from the farm, as a family.  Making memories, trying any and every fishing spot we could find, watching our daughter fall asleep by the fire with nothing but the breeze blowing and the ocean crashing behind her.\n\n6 years has gone by in the blink of an eye. But we are a testament that if you stay focused and keep hustling and working, you absolutely will get your moments back. Not over night, but it will come.

Instead of wasting garden space on a huge vining plant, we threw our luffa seeds at the base of some of our trees in our power line easement. It\u2019s a spot that our meat chickens actually go through and fertilize at different times of the year and a space that has rich, well draining soil.  It also gets some sun as well but not full sun.  We wanted to see what it would be like growing not only chickens for meat on the forest floor level, but oaks dropping acorns from above and luffa gourds thriving in between and throughout.\n\nAnd to our surprise, the luffa plants started to grow!  And grow!  And grow some more!  They have grown ALL over some of the trees and have produced huge luffa gourds!  Some of these trees were deciduous and have lost their leaves as the weather has changed and in the process have left the luffa vines on them little protection from frost as transpiration rates have nearly halted. Those gourds on our deciduous trees have now died and dried.  But some of the trees that the vines were growing on were our Southern Live Oaks which are nearly an evergreen and have continued the process of transpiration helping protect vines from freezing temps. And believe it or not, the vines in our oaks although not producing new flowers, are still green with green ripening gourds!\n\nToday we got to pick some of the dried luffas from the trees!  We just needed a big extension ladder and a fearless barefoot helper!  There\u2019s still lots growing that we will just have to patiently wait for!  It was a fun experiment and we shook out more seeds from the dried luffas beneath the trees again to see if they\u2019ll continue the trend this coming summer when it\u2019s time!

can\u2019t do this without the support of the people.\u201d Will Harris, another leader in regenerative agriculture recently said this.

Believe me, I love support from afar, I love sharing what we do and impacting others to shop local in their local communities.  But what I want to see is the locals here that say, \u201cwe support what you do,\u201d come out to market and show that support.  Because the farmer cannot do this, without the support of the people.  As a farm, we have stayed true to our roots in keeping it local, truly local, providing for our local community & not offering shipping.  We believe there is a lot of difference to be made right here in our backyard. But we cannot do it without the support of the people.  We cannot make the difference our world needs without the support of the people.\n\nOf course, our products are more expensive than the grocery store. Because they are far superior. I stopped at the gas station today for a bag of pretzels, peanuts & water & spent $13.  That\u2019s how much one pack of our sausage costs, that can easily feed multiple people a far more nutrient dense meal than those awful vending machine snacks I ate for breakfast today driving home from the butcher.\n\nTomorrow we\u2019ll be in Savannah at Forsyth Farmers Market from 9am to 1pm.\n\nNothing worth doing is ever easy. We all have a thousand excuses why we can\u2019t shop local or make a market. But WE CANNOT DO THIS WORK WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE.  Nothing about farming regeneratively is easy or cheap. But I can promise you, it\u2019s always worth it.\n\nTomorrow, make it a point to shop local. Whether with myself or anyone else. Because we cannot make a difference without the support of the people.  Tomorrow please come out and help be the change you wish to see here, in our local Lowcountry Community!", "total_engagement": 792, "engagement_rate": 0.0033669174850146665, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-17T22:42:21.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "communities", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "locals", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "pack", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "difference", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "&", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "community", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "times", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "market", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "will harris", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "support", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "folks", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "pretzels", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "farmer", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "others", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "peanuts & water &", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132473785581, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-24T09:52:05.260Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-24T09:52:05.260Z"}, {"id": 607775132473785580, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-357707298", "created_at": "2023-11-24T09:52:05.251Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-24T09:52:05.251Z"}, {"id": 607775132474868858, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-24T18:20:35.280Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T18:36:46.157Z"}, {"id": 607775132474868859, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-11-24T18:20:35.285Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T18:36:46.161Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175343795800, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CzxAN0oux4T/", "post_id": "3238370556927221267", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/73239cff519af60711061da3da4a7340.JPEG", "phash": "d1e8861e3462f56d", "image_entities": [{"entity": "audience", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9783039093017578}, {"entity": "crowd", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6514167785644531}, {"entity": "facial expression", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5801705121994019}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.35573917627334595}, {"entity": "product", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34810417890548706}, {"entity": "smile", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23374223709106445}, {"entity": "internet meme", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22865571081638336}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5760836005210876}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.39028868079185486}, {"entity": "bird", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.38303518295288086}, {"entity": "bird", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.26554927229881287}, {"entity": "chicken", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2649660110473633}, {"entity": "overall", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2349971979856491}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20790299773216248}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-11-21T03:44:30.233Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-21T06:07:35.690Z"}}], "post_text": "Our egg chickens are in leased pastures and we are limited on predator control tactics we can employ.

Whether you\u2019re buying a $5 bundle of collards from us,  a large monthly subscription, or you\u2019re leaving the spare change you can afford, in the box at the stand, EVERY contribution to our farm helps contribute to EVERYONE having access to real food and helping us take steps to healing our food system and our communities.\n\nTomorrow, Wednesday, November 22 from 12pm until gone at the PAY WHAT YOU CAN Produce Stand at 870 Tillman Road, Ridgeland 29936 please come out and TAKE WHAT YOU NEED and PAY WHAT YOU CAN!  There will be meats in the freezer, eggs and of course a selection of veggies.\n\nAs a reminder the farm is not open to the public but you can easily access the stand at the head of the drive before the gates to the farm.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving \ud83e\udd83 it\u2019s an honor to be able to feed our local community!", "total_engagement": 799, "engagement_rate": 0.003396675594099392, "network_type":

you wish to see in the world is never an easy task. It\u2019s often met with great resistance.  I would know first hand.  I have fought many battles locally for acceptance and support from my community for the work we do and still fight battles for acceptance to this day.  But I\u2019ve never experienced the battles that my friend Mady in Laurens, South Carolina has had to face in her small town.\n\nMady is an urban farmer breaking no laws or regulations, farming on her small piece of property in Laurens, South Carolina. Mady has a weekly subscription for her veggies, sells to restaurants and donates veg to local non profits.  Mady has 3 kids, 1 of whom has special needs.  Her urban farm allows her to make a small living while providing for others so she can be there for the frequent appointments her son Boone has.\n\nOn any given day Mady wakes up to tags on social media of disgruntled neighbors angry because her front yard is a garden and not a lawn.  She has faced vandalism to her plants, strong resistance from the town to be able to put a small donation based produce stand up at her walkway and of course, the many complaints she gets to her face and behind her back about her eyesore garden.\n\nYesterday morning however, she woke up to a new kind of attack.  Confirmed by the authorities, someone broke into Mady\u2019s yard in the middle of the night and stabbed her three goats to death.  Muddy footprints, finger prints, video footage and wound examination confirmed, this was a deliberate attack.  It came just a week after another Facebook post surfaced of more neighbors angry about her front yard garden.\n\nI couldn\u2019t be more disappointed in Laurens, SC right now. I\u2019m disappointed because as a collective, you\u2019ve let the negative voices overpower the positive when it comes to Mady and the work she does for her local community.  For anyone that supports her initiative you\u2019ve stayed silent for far too long.  The time is now to stand up and support her.  Mady isn\u2019t going to quit, in fact her fire burns more fiercely than before.\n\nWays to support her work & her right to farm and provide are listed in the comments!", "total_engagement": 2806, "engagement_rate": 0.011928750584534286, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-23T19:18:17.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "battles", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "world", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "attack", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "resistance", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "grain", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "laurens", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "task", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "acceptance", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mady", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "change", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132490114967, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-03T20:17:29.696Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-03T20:17:29.696Z"}, {"id": 607775132490114966, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-252023757", "created_at": "2023-12-03T20:17:29.689Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-03T20:17:29.689Z"}, {"id": 607775132491375031, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-04T16:40:54.829Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-07T15:32:52.059Z"}, {"id": 607775132491375035, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-12-04T16:40:54.837Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-07T15:32:52.064Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175351518573, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C0EkzZAu5-n/", "post_id": "3243879492837154727", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/e87bf2220004aa9867b42076fb335614.JPEG", "phash": "cd99311b3ba82a3d", "image_entities": [{"entity": "biome", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9840496778488159}, {"entity": "forest", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9698534607887268}, {"entity": "grove", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9506846070289612}, {"entity": "natural environment", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9316684007644653}, {"entity": "northern hardwood forest", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9163258075714111}, {"entity": "natural landscape", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7151108384132385}, {"entity": "nature reserve", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6571497917175293}, {"entity": "nature", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4068532884120941}, {"entity": "old-growth forest", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.312254399061203}, {"entity": "trail", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24763993918895721}, {"entity": "tree", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24235811829566956}, {"entity": "woodland", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21090067923069}, {"entity": "tropical and subtropical coniferous forests", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2058221399784088}, {"entity": "chandelier", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5064153671264648}, {"entity": "gate", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.47156238555908203}, {"entity": "cow", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3906233608722687}, {"entity": "bridge", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.29061341285705566}, {"entity": "cow", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22395093739032745}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-12-11T01:41:28.098Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-31T09:38:58.237Z"}}], "post_text": "There\u2019s a time in my life I don\u2019t remember many details from, bits and pieces find their way into my memory.  It was a time of turmoil in my life, a lot of anti-psychotics and hospitalizations.  It was a time of my life when my cheeks were stained with tears, far more often then they were stretched from smiling.  A time of my life when I nearly ended it. I\u2019m a true testament to the saying of \u201cI promise it gets better,\u201d because it does.\n\nOver 10 years have passed since that time but I\u2019m still healing.  But one of the biggest things that has helped me in my healing has been serving others.  My farm is my refuge and it has brought me the greatest healing.  While it does at times bring me great heartache and hurt, the healing of this farm, far outweighs all the struggles.  I serve others in many ways on this farm.\n\nI serve my father who passed away not long after my last hospitalization through the native ecosystem regeneration work we do, as my father was a biologist and I feel most connected to him on this land.  I serve my daughter through creating a legacy for her and teaching her how to leave the earth in a better condition than we found it and to serve others in the process.  I serve my husband by giving him a chance to do work he loves, building, growing, creating and staying in touch with the roots his family established long ago in the soils along the South Georgia coast.  I serve my employees by being 100% committed to caring for them and doing my absolute best by them, as they care so much for our business, our farm and our family.\n\nI also serve my community in perhaps one of the most special relationships of servitude I host.  All of the other relationships I mentioned above, leave an impact I see in almost a tangible measurement.  But the community is one that stretches so much further and wider than what I could ever imagine seeing.  It\u2019s the impact that brings me the greatest hope, because the work we share leaves our mark in places I\u2019ll never know about and never realize.  The ripple effect that goes long beyond the gates to this farm.  Thank you for being apart of my healing. And if you\u2019re struggling, hold on.

We served meats from the farm and sides, had gifts for the kids and even had Santa and Mrs. Claus visit.  It was truly the most special way to spend Christmas (which happens to be my birthday too \ud83d\ude0a).\n\nThis has been such a challenging year for our business though that honestly, I haven\u2019t really caught my breath since January and the holidays are already upon us. We just can\u2019t pull off an event that size this year.\n\nBut we still, as always want to make sure we can be there for our community. So today we took some time out and decorated the PAY WHAT YOU CAN Produce Stand!  And over the next couple of weeks we\u2019ll be announcing ways you can make sure our neighbors do not go without this holiday season!  Our farm is an important option for folks who don\u2019t have the ability to travel to some of the organizations closer to town.\n\nOn December 17th, we\u2019ll be stocking the PAY WHAT YOU CAN Produce Stand with veggies for the holidays but we\u2019ll also be putting gifts under the tree and whole chickens and breakfast bundles in the freezer!\n\nWe already have bins and bins of wrapped and age labeled gifts ready to go out under the tree.  And we\u2019ll be doing a Whole Chicken Drive and Holiday Breakfast Bundle Drive to put our meats out on the stand!

It was a crazy busy day.  I sent them my mileage walked for the day and told them highest mileage tracked gets lunch on the farm tab!

It\u2019s not always about the frost itself but the length of time it stays below freezing.  And while the forecast often gives us one temperature, we\u2019ve learned at our farm, it will most likely always fall a few degrees lower than the predicted temps.  Also because our temperatures fluctuate so much, going from very warm one day to freezing the next, it\u2019s always good to cover plants that just aren\u2019t as hardened off to the cold as they would be if it was consistently cold.  Even if doesn\u2019t drop enough to truly warrant the effort we put out, at least we tuned up our frost cloth skills for the next time!\n\nI\u2019m so glad we\u2019re prepared this year just in case

Before 8am and before I\u2019d even sipped my coffee she was on her horse. I walked out in the field & started coaching her. She wasn\u2019t doing much of anything, just trotting a circle. But it was slick from the morning frost, more so than I realized and Willow lost her footing & slid out, onto her side, throwing Ellie down with her.  It tossed Ellie at the perfect angle to twist her foot in the stirrup as she went down and Ellie\u2019s foot got stuck in the stirrup.  I watched on as Willow jumped up, startled by Ellie hanging at her side and took off running, dragging Ellie along with her.  After about 60\u2019 Ellie dropped and I caught up to her. Ellie immediately jumped up and with tears in her eyes and panicked screams she told me, \u201cI\u2019m ok! I\u2019m ok!\u201d I grabbed her and pulled her helmet off of her and examined her face and head. I unzipped her coat & checked her body. \u201cWhat about Willow?!\u201d she cried. \u201cWillow is fine, we\u2019ll grab her after we check you.\u201d I took her remaining boot off and her socks and nearly stripped her down right in that frosty grass. She was, fine.  Her helmet did it\u2019s job and the Carhart jacket she was wearing, gave her plenty of padding as she bounced against Willow\u2019s back leg.\n\nAnd in the seconds as I watched this unfold, the memories flashed in my head. The baby in my belly as I broke that Marsh Tacky.  Her very own first horse at 6 months old.  The day she handed over a fat wad of cash to buy Willow from money she\u2019d saved herself selling eggs and modeling for Duluth Trading Company.  The falls, the injuries, the ER visits, the accidents, the triumphs.  The lessons. The close calls that have always become our lessons.\n\nThe lesson today\u2026 mom ordered some loads of sand for footing in that pasture so Willow has better footing.  The triumph\u2026 she was totally ok.  And she got back on.  Always get back on.", "total_engagement": 2166, "engagement_rate": 0.009208009182502232, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-12-01T03:47:21.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [],

We\u2019ll also be putting wrapped and age labeled gifts under the tree as well and have been collecting gifts!  If you\u2019d like to send a gift, we are in need of gifts for teens.  You are welcome to order on Amazon and send to the farm address with the Attention to: PAY WHAT YOU CAN.

loaded the last of the chickens for our 2023 poultry program to head up to the USDA Processor.  This year we have faced MANY challenges when it comes to our poultry and I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t looking forward to a 3 month break before we start back up with 2024\u2019s poultry program.\n\n We used to process a lot of poultry on the farm. But this year, we took all of our chickens, aside from what we processed for ourselves up to the USDA.  Because we sell over state lines our poultry had to be USDA inspected. And because our processor is 3 hours away, we try to do large groups of chickens from March until December to minimize our drive time.\n\nThe most common reaction we get when we tell people that we raise our chickens in the forests without any coops or man made shelter is intense skepticism.  Folks assume our losses are incredibly high due to predators. And while we do lose chickens to predators, we lose chickens to other issues too. Like when we lost over 50 out of 700 in one of our batches in the first 24 hours after arrival due to longer than normal shipping time.\n\nAfter the final count tonight on the trailer, in spite of all of the challenges, 89.9% of the chickens we ordered this season will make it or have made it to the freezer, leaving us at a 10.1% overall loss.  It\u2019s impossible to have perfect batches.  There will always be loss on a farm. There will always be predators. There will always be challenges out of our control.\n\nBut I would choose this method of raising our chickens a thousand times over as opposed to raising them in chicken tractors or raising them as \u201cfree range\u201d in a chicken house.  The value of the end product, the nutrient density and the impact these chickens have on our forest systems as they move through, will always be far greater than all of the challenges we face.\n\nTo our loyal customers, we are so proud to work hard, day after day, through challenges seen and unseen to provide you all with the most absolutely unadulterated poultry product available in our area.  And shout out to our team for a very successful, albeit challenging 2023 Poultry Season!", "total_engagement": 1119, "engagement_rate": 0.004757046295115419, "network_type": "instagram",

We taught Victoria and Joseph how to skin their deer down and quarter it. They\u2019ll finish cutting it down today. Ellie and I worked to debone ours. We\u2019ll pass along all the deboned meat to Ryan who will take it and combine it with our pork fat and grind us all burger. \n\nNot even the dogs were left out, who eat raw and LOVE venison, especially when it\u2019s fresh and they spent the evening occupied with their ham and shoulder bones.\n\nAlthough we don\u2019t usually have time to hunt, our friend Bill and other friends usually always try to hook us up every year with deer, wild pig and even gator when they get it.  We\u2019re always grateful to have the space to process the animals down, plenty of mouths to feed on the farm and an opportunity to teach new skills to our team.", "total_engagement": 831, "engagement_rate": 0.003532712664200995, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-12-12T13:44:29.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "earth", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "place", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ryan", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "dogs", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "community", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "others", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "skills", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "food", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "farm", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "friends", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132545496423, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-19T15:32:38.740Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-19T15:32:38.740Z"}, {"id": 607775132545496415, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1318305369", "created_at": "2023-12-19T15:32:38.728Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-19T15:32:38.728Z"}, {"id": 607775132595645335, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-28T18:03:48.706Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-13T18:54:59.039Z"}, {"id": 607775132595645337, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-12-28T18:03:48.710Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-13T18:54:59.065Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175366937714, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C0zd3i0OWBy/", "post_id": "3257078315822440562", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/6d667923eb81375226e6e2a0238910d4.JPEG", "phash": "dd9c96492394abe2", "image_entities": [{"entity": "botany", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.401498407125473}, {"entity": "painting", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.31643256545066833}, {"entity": "watercolor paint", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.28122588992118835}, {"entity": "glasses", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5295840501785278}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4954409599304199}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4201700687408447}, {"entity": "man", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.27119699120521545}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-12-21T02:33:55.157Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-09T17:59:18.960Z"}}], "post_text": "Since December 1st, we have serviced 75 of our Lowcountry Farm Subscribers for their monthly meat, veggie and egg subscriptions with goods from the farm.

But what\u2019s most important to us, is that folks get the best selection available and unfortunately, we just would have too limited a quantity this week if we went forward with it as planned.\n\nOn Friday, December 22nd, we will be stocking the PAY WHAT YOU CAN Produce Stand with lots of beautiful veggies!  We\u2019ll also be offering FRESH whole chickens that we processed on the farm, ready to go into your ovens for your holiday meal on the 24th or 25th AND breakfast meats for your holiday breakfasts as well!

This means we do not disturb the soil in our gardens. We don\u2019t use tractors or  tillers, we don\u2019t even typically pull weeds.  Instead when beds become overrun with weeds we cover with silage tarp until the weeds die and the weeds too go back into the soil as future nutrients.  We don\u2019t even broad fork any more now that our gardens are established and the soil has become better and more loose from years of no till practices.\n\nOne of the most important aspects for us is layering.  Layering helps us feed our soil and the microbes in it, so they can feed our plants. And to keep weeds down, mulching, season after season, plays an important roll too.\n\nNot only does our mulching feed the soil as it breaks down year after year, but it also helps with water retention during dry spells, drainage and erosion control during rainy seasons AND weed suppression.\n\nWe do most of our mulching in the winters when it\u2019s cooler and the warm season weeds have died back.  It\u2019s a lot more tolerable to get mulching done when it isn\u2019t crazy hot out.\n\nWe find using the tractor or skid steer to dump into multiple wheelbarrows at once, allow us to get the mulching down more quickly. Something else different from our farm other than a typical market garden\u2026 we always keep our rows wide enough for a two wheeled wheelbarrow to fit down. This makes working in our gardens so much more enjoyable for our team.  We could certainly save financial resources, like mulch and generate more revenue with additional growing spaces by narrowing our walkways.

Actually, 2023 has been the year of investing in all kinds of garden glow ups.\n\nAfter sitting just absolutely crammed to the brim with plants in the Potting Shed last spring (photo 3), we decided as a team, come hell or high water, we couldn\u2019t operate out of it for another season with seedlings.  So after we finished putting up the new high tunnel, we went ahead and ordered a second smaller version which is now \u201cThe Greenhouse.\u201d\n\nWe try really hard to listen to suggestions from our team, because let\u2019s face it, they are the ones in the field. Something that was desperately needed was more room for soil blocking, potting up and tool storage. So this past week, we removed all of the corrugated plastic from The Potting Shed, replaced it with T1-11, had volunteers come out and paint it, knocked down some pine trees AND added 10 extra feet of lean-to.  We still have grow lights inside on shelves so it will still be used for germinating seedlings but it\u2019s now a much more functional space.\n\nWe have 4 gardens, soon to be 5, spread out around the farm. We have them spread for wildlife buffers and to allow us to incorporate rotational grazing next to them with our livestock as well as incorporating fruit trees around them.  But with the buffers, that means A LOT of walking back and forth. We needed storage space closer to the back gardens for bulky wheelbarrows and tools that could be dedicated to those gardens.  So we finished up at the Potting Shed and moved to the Field Garden shed.  Today we completed it!\n\nWe bought our land 4 years ago after selling our first small farm that we ran our business off of for 1 year.  The big farm was nothing but overgrown forests.

It\u2019s when we do things and make choices to make other people happy, no matter if it makes ourselves happy or not.  Sometimes you have to \u201cpeople please\u201d like when you\u2019re asked to clean things up that you don\u2019t feel like, or go somewhere with mom and dad when you don\u2019t feel like it.

Her door closed and I immediately felt sick. She had gone and stayed so many times, but there was something about not having her around for Christmas that suddenly had me regretting my little pep talk to her.  She deserved Christmas magic and her cousins and her grandma and Zia. She deserved an opportunity to do something other than feeding hogs on her holiday.\n\nAs they pulled away, I started crying inconsolably. So much crying I made myself sick. I realized this was it, this was what it feels like, when they start making their own choices, start spreading their wings.

They get a little less than 1/4 pound per bird per day and they are always really happy to get their supplementation. This provides them with additional minerals and protein to guarantee a balanced diet and healthy, happy birds while they rotate through our forests and pastures.

And while that\u2019s fine, she really needed another horse, especially because the cows come and go and move a lot more frequently than Willow needs to.\n\nWe\u2019ve always taken great care of our horses and all of our livestock.  We don\u2019t spare much expense when making sure they have what they need.  And this has given me an opportunity to have a great relationship with my vets.\n\nI mentioned again to one of my vets recently that I was still looking for a partner for Willow and another horse for Ellie and she had one in mind.\n\nWhiskey comes to us from @scadequestrianteam after being apart of their beginner riding program for the last almost 10 years. He\u2019s ready to retire from the jumping ring and enjoy a life of trails and having a little girl that spoils him.\n\nWe got to bring him home today and introduce him to Willow. And I\u2019d say we\u2019re all pretty happy to have him here, especially Willow!\n\nI feel so grateful and even flattered that SCAD would even consider us as a home for Whiskey.  He is proof that if you\u2019re patient and you keep going, eventually you\u2019ll find what youre looking for.  Welcome Whiskey to our farm family!  We can\u2019t thank @scaddotedu enough and one of our awesome vets for helping make this happen!  Can\u2019t wait to see how retirement looks on Whiskey! and yes\u2026 he is as huge as he looks and makes Willow look like a pony \ud83d\ude02", "total_engagement": 1569, "engagement_rate": 0.006670067593419207, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2024-01-04T22:59:34.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "horses", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "willow", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "horse", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "market", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "scaddotedu"}, {"name": "scadequestrianteam"}], "categories": [{"name": "Hobbies & Lifestyle", "confidence": 0.9659020304679871}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132612832489, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.114Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.114Z"}, {"id": 607775132612832488, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1240286606", "created_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.112Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.112Z"}, {"id": 607775132612929602, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-14T17:02:16.078Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-25T15:47:38.060Z"}, {"id": 607775132612929603, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "0", "created_at": "2024-01-14T17:02:16.083Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-25T15:47:38.066Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175389405832, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C1zFMi-uXm3/", "post_id": "3274984206454323639", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/d297b8add490ec9c0b6f3fabd0dac7ef.JPEG", "phash": "e284397b6c943967", "image_entities": [], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": null, "custom_object_detection_version": null, "custom_label_detection_version": null, "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2024-01-21T02:02:34.523Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-21T02:02:34.523Z"}}], "post_text": "Chick season will be here before you know it!\n\nSo you wanna be a chicken farmer?\n\nYea, chicks are cute and fluffy and chickens are fun and lovable creatures who produce delicious eggs and/or meat!  But there\u2019s a lot more to it than that!\n\nPasty Butt is just one issue you may encounter when raising chicks!\n\nPasty Butt happens to about 5-10% of our chicks. And we raise thousands every year. And while you can help prevent it by adding ACV to water and making sure they have a clean and warm brooder with the correct temperature and humidity levels, it can still happen. So know what to look for and be prepared!  Pasty butt can be deadly as it can block the vent, preventing chicks from excreting waste. So as long as you\u2019re checking vents and watching for signs and helping address them as they arrive, your chicks will thrive!  We have found that after about a week of life, it\u2019s no longer an issue and chicks have moved past the pasty butt danger zone!\n\nWarm water works great too. But for us, we prefer to treat them immediately as we see them, instead of worrying about going and grabbing warm water every time we see a chick that needs treating. So we keep coconut oil at the brooder and it does the trick. I also prefer to not use gloves and just wash my hands after because I can feel more easily and be so much more gentle without gloves.", "total_engagement": 1948, "engagement_rate": 0.008281256642435064, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2024-01-07T12:00:25.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "acv", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "chickens", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lot", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "butt", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "eggs", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "chick season", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "creatures", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "issue", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "meat", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132612832491, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.172Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.172Z"}, {"id": 607775132612832490, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1655100344", "created_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.170Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.170Z"}, {"id": 607775132612929606, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-14T17:02:16.102Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-25T15:47:38.086Z"}, {"id": 607775132612929607, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "0", "created_at": "2024-01-14T17:02:16.106Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-25T15:47:38.092Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175389405839, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C10eH3ltinH/", "post_id": "3275375311125359047", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/c39b6fa570ff4a9877a20a7117417f22.JPEG", "phash": "de9ac0711ff38c50", "image_entities": [], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": null, "custom_object_detection_version": null, "custom_label_detection_version": null, "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2024-01-21T02:02:32.202Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-21T02:02:32.202Z"}}], "post_text": "Come find inspiration and cultivate connection with so many other women farmers and Women in Ag in the South East at the @clemsonscwagn Annual Conference!

They are extra sensitive to heat and humidity and a lot of those factors can help be controlled by the way you give them access to water.  We brood out anywhere from 600 to 800 chicks at a time, every 4-6 weeks. It takes a lot of extra time changing out small, 1 gallon water containers 2x-3x per day for all those chicks. But they are just too little for bigger containers as they can drown in the basin of them.\n\nTo be able to use the bigger containers anyway, we line the basin of the large 3 gallon containers with small rocks. It allows the chicks a safe place to climb and perch to get water, keeps them safe and dry and warm and it also cuts chore time WAY down for us, only having to wash and fill waters 1x per day.  It also keeps the brooder cleaner and dryer as there is no accidental splashing from the chicks falling into the basin and trying to get out.  This keeps their temperature regulated and the humidity in the brooder regulated too.  You\u2019d be surprised how much of a difference just having some damp bedding can make in the environment for them and their success growing into strong adult chickens.\n\nAs they get bigger, you can reduce the amount of rocks to allow them more room or you can remove the rocks all together!  Spring is just around the corner, so give this a try in your brooder this coming year and let us know if it helps!", "total_engagement": 648, "engagement_rate": 0.0027547506695574544, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2024-01-08T11:11:39.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "care", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "anywhere", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lot", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "basin", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "attention", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "factors", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "water", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "humidity", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "heat", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132612832507, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.415Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.415Z"}, {"id": 607775132612832506, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "2081428583", "created_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.413Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.413Z"}, {"id": 607775132612929612, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-14T17:02:16.172Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-25T15:47:38.162Z"}, {"id": 607775132612929613, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "0", "created_at": "2024-01-14T17:02:16.178Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-25T15:47:38.167Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175389405837, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C15cBs4u4_H/", "post_id": "3276773466106990535", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/493dc8995be655530c9df6c9e866d8da.JPEG", "phash": "c1bc4db18b3dc833", "image_entities": [], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": null, "custom_object_detection_version": null, "custom_label_detection_version": null, "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2024-01-21T02:02:29.892Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-21T02:02:29.892Z"}}], "post_text": "Earlier today, I looked out into the gardens and the team was buckled down, rain gear on, winds whipping, harvesting for our Lowcountry Farm Boxes.  James and I rode by on the tractor on our way to repair fence lines.\n\nToday was one of those days when it was dangerous to be on our farm. Because of how we farm in the forest, there\u2019s very few places, including our gardens, that you walk that you aren\u2019t under trees.  Today like usual we worked. The only thing that was different though was no one except James and myself went out on fence lines and in the dense forests because of the trees and limbs falling.  We worked fence lines making repairs most of the morning, limbs cracking over head and falling nearby as we worked. We loaded pigs in the trailer for processing, slipping and sliding into the electric fencing at the chute more times than I could count.  A day like today makes me think about how some days we\u2019re literally out here nearly dying, trying to feed others.  Days like today make me wonder if I\u2019ve lost my mind. Am I insane to care so deeply about this way of farming and providing for others?  Maybe. I still can\u2019t decide.\n\nIf you are local to our area and you too believe, like us that this kind of work and this kind of food is important, you\u2019ve come to the right place.

Whether you are able to subscribe for $175, $275 or $375 monthly, every commitment level matters to us. Your subscription is so much more than just food. It\u2019s nutrients for your family, meaningful work for some of your neighbors and it supports a family, out there, giving it their all, day in and day out trying to leave their slice of land, far better than they found it.\n\nMake it a point to shop local this year and make choices that help better impact your community as a whole.\n\nVisit lowcountryfarmbox.com for all the details and to add yourself to the waitlist!\n\nAnd to our current almost 70 subscribers, we appreciate you all so very much!

But you\u2019ll find plenty of our organic fed chicken, pork, beef and even eggs at the Forsyth Farmers Market tomorrow!", "total_engagement": 338, "engagement_rate": 0.0014368915529481784, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2024-01-13T02:06:17.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "victoria", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ryan", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "whiskey", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "alisa", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "weather", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "addition", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "market", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "home", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "baby", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "family", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sister", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "plenty", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "chaos", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "veggies", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "experience", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "help", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bit", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "farm", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "storms", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "forsythfarmersmarket"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132612832524, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.670Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.670Z"}, {"id": 607775132612832523, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1179957110", "created_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.668Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.668Z"}, {"id": 607775132612929620, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-14T17:02:16.239Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-25T15:47:38.236Z"}, {"id": 607775132612929621, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "0", "created_at": "2024-01-14T17:02:16.245Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-25T15:47:38.242Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175390049537, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C2D35u3OabI/", "post_id": "3279710813542786760", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/f8291575c9af3ebce84129232aead7c7.JPEG", "phash": "8ff000f0beb6b714", "image_entities": [], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": null, "custom_object_detection_version": null, "custom_label_detection_version": null, "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2024-01-21T02:02:42.794Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-21T02:02:42.794Z"}}], "post_text": "This past week Phoebe celebrated her 3 year mark with our farm and her one year mark as the Farm Manager.\n\nPhoebe started with me 3 years ago as a volunteer. She was taking her life in a different direction and trying to find her footing and some meaning. Three days per week she\u2019d come out and bust her ass for free, simply because she believed in the mission and most of all she believed in me.  We grew close during her time, chatting on the porch, sharing a beer on a Friday.  We\u2019d brainstorm and bounce ideas off of each other. At times, I\u2019d cry to her when things were hard.  She\u2019d encourage me and push me forward and help me find the humor.  Phoebe has seen me at my best and my lowest on the farm. She\u2019s seen my truest, ugliest parts, the growing pains of a leader, the mistakes and she\u2019s seen so much of the triumphs.\n\nI\u2019ve watched her change and grow too, learning the most special parts of her. I\u2019ve learned her kindness towards others and how she nurtures her friends and her friendships.  Doing for others and going out of her way for others, fills her and fuels her. She\u2019s thoughtful and honest and the kind of friend you want to have on your team.  But more than that, she\u2019s driven and she\u2019s so smart.  And she\u2019s the kind of leader who leads by example.\n\nPhoebe has grown into her role this last year with such grace. She has almost single handedly grown and managed our Lowcountry Farm Box program by adding 30+ subscribers in the last year, almost DOUBLING our monthly revenue from this program.  She has cultivated relationships with chefs, landing us weekly accounts with restaurants we feel so lucky to be partners with.  She has helped develop our team, assisting in training 6 new employees in just this last year.  Phoebe handles all things post production on the farm from customers to products to inventory management to supplies and more.\n\nI honestly can\u2019t believe how far we\u2019ve come together. Often telling the greenhorns, \u201clook, you have no idea how hard it used to be.\u201d But she stuck by me and us and the mission. Thanks for a great year, Pheebs. We love you.  Mentoring and leading you has been one of the best parts of my farming journey thus far.", "total_engagement": 621, "engagement_rate": 0.002639969391659227, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2024-01-14T00:26:57.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "phoebe", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mark", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "farm", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132612832527, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.720Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.720Z"}, {"id": 607775132612832526, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1470270259", "created_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.718Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T16:08:01.718Z"}, {"id": 607775132612929622, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-14T17:02:16.264Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-25T15:47:38.260Z"}, {"id": 607775132612929623, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "0", "created_at": "2024-01-14T17:02:16.269Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-25T15:47:38.267Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": null, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/theexecutiveinoveralls", "post_id": "e97975f5-5daf-49be-b458-8f441709d9dd", "program_id": null, "location": null, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/BioMatch_placeholder_v2.jpg", "phash": null, "image_entities": null, "phash_property": null}], "post_text": "Life through the eyes of the Executive in Overalls, owner of Whippoorwill Farms SC, a commercial, bio diverse regenerative farm in SC.  #1243437", "total_engagement": null, "engagement_rate": null, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2024-01-14T09:33:20.000Z", "brands": null, "text_entities": null, "hashtags": null, "mentions": null, "categories": null, "post_properties": null}]}
