Thinking of my years in the classroom in terms of seasons has helped me to navigate within them, but also gives me hope.\nA brief word on winter:\nIt is stark, but also beautiful. \nIt can feel isolating, but does not require loneliness. \nWhere things may seem dead, there is life waiting to emerge under the right conditions.\nOne thing that I cling to on the rough years is my peers. Could be teammates, maybe not. Being with the right people recharges me. Inspires me. Encourages me.\nPouring into others gives me a great deal of joy, but winter requires me to conserve my energies.\nI hold in tension my desire to do more, while recognizing that doing less is what needs to happen so that I begin to thrive, rather than just survive.\nTime away from school has been so precious--not because I don't love my job, but because sometimes I love it too much and don't love myself enough. \nI share these reflections with you in the hope that you know you are not alone. That others with much more experience are also struggling, but pressing on. That we are always better in community.\nI am thankful for the community that I have and that supports me in real time.\nI pray your time away helps to remind you of the good in this calling too. \u2764\ufe0f", "total_engagement": 446, "engagement_rate": 0.013217164532954007, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-27T07:00:01.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "season", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "peers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "word", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "classroom", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teammates", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "posts", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "community", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "times", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "terms", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tension", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "social media", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "desire", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hope", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "deal", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "career", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lack", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "joy", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "others", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "seasons", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132062639811, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:21.771Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:21.771Z"}, {"id": 607775132062639807, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "292503102", "created_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:21.767Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:21.767Z"}, {"id": 607775132188535787, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T09:27:16.211Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T23:57:41.590Z"}, {"id": 607775132188535788, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-08-22T09:27:16.218Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T23:57:41.606Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175119757262, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CmzEby-ucNy/", "post_id": "3004764878737621874", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "Y'all.\nI have been working with a ton of rookie teachers over the last decade or so.

I am busy living my life that weekend, so I feel guilty when I pass it and think of what needs to be done. Sunday night late,  go through it and get distracted again. Monday I am waking up early to try and get to some of it that has to be done before teaching and I am stressed because I am late and didn't get coffee, forgot to pack lunch, or both.\nThat's exhausting and demoralizing. \nTeacher guilt is real over so much.\nI am pretty sure one of the reasons my workload is heavy is because this year, I am new to a lot. New grade level, new curriculum, new procedures at school, new administrators and coaches...etc. In order to really understand where my students are with new standards and curriculum,  I am grading a ton. I DO feel better about knowing how to help them, but initially, it took too much time away from me doing what fills me up.\nAn adjustment I have made is to stagger my work. There are weekends like this one, where I planned to do nothing because there was a lot going on for me personally. Last weekend. I worked ahead and I am all set except for two engineering projects I need to design for my STEAM Club members. That can wait, though, because it is Tuesday. \nAnother thing that is helping is electronic grading where I can. This week, I will have several after school activities. I have planned to require less graded work this week...or make it electronic to ease my burden a bit. \nThe reality is, teachers have always worked from home. It will continue. What's toxic is feeling bad for living your life because of your job. This post-Covid landscape has all of us taking on WAY TOO MUCH.

It doesn't have to be perfect to be relevant or effective. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAs the coach of a competitive STEAM team, I get tons of opportunities to create engaging lessons. My closet is stocked with extra randomness. \ud83e\udd23Every time I come up with some standards aligned hair brained scheme, my kids just come along for the adventure. I love them! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI started the lesson with a number puzzle. I just like to hear them reason things out. They are so fun to listen to! Then, we watched a short clip of someone riding a large coaster and discussed the experience. I had them  read about force and motion featuring roller coasters, next. Scholastic magazine has so many great articles! We discussed what we would need in order build a roller coaster using a ping pong ball to replicate the experience. I gave them the materials and about 5 minutes to discuss and brainstorm. They were given 2 sheets of construction paper, a Solo cup, tape, paper clips, scissors, toothpicks and 5 index cards. After 25 minutes, we had two teams with two coasters!! The discussions were so fun! They did so well!!\n\nBeing creative helps me in this season, so much! Watching students become creative with a lesson I made? Priceless! I hope this week you find joy in something too. \u2764\ufe0f", "total_engagement": 174, "engagement_rate": 0.005156472261735419, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at":

they KNOW you love them.\nThey. Will. Not. Break. If. You. Consistently. Discipline. \nBut if your kids are starting to turn up?\nYou need these tips.\n1. Don't beg.\nWeakness in a classroom screams you don't know what to do. Most kids today are being raised to be a bit more independent. If you look like you don't know what to do? Bet....they will take over, because SOMEBODY has got to be in charge.\n2. Pick up your cadence. \nSome of y'all may not realize that you are talking too slowly and instead of it helping understanding its making the lesson run too long and you're losing them...which animates off task behavior. Talk faster. Use gestures. Tell them to buckle up. They got this!\n3. Tighten up transitions.\nReward those who are doing things efficiently and not wasting your time. Table points work great in my room. Thank them for valuing your time and everyone else's!\n4. Put some base in your voice.\nNow. I didn't say yell. I mean speak with authority.

That's not stopping me from taking 10 minutes out of the top of my lessons to introduce my kids to an influential Black American. \nEach day, I talk about a different Black American and on Fridays, we do a joy & culture lesson. \nOur reading classes are working on an American Revolution unit, so many of my famous African Americans are related to men and women connected to the time period or the military this year!\nSo many interesting stories to tell! \ud83d\udda4\nLet me remind you, there are so many rich lessons you can teach through the Florida Social Studies standards.

to departmentalize. Since Christmas, I have been teaching just math & science to mine and a partner teachers kids.\nMy other class is sweet too. I enjoy them, but it's so different when you long for the comfort of familiarity. Starting something mid year was tough. \nA broader narrative that I have been thinking about too--particularly as someone truly purposed for elementary school--is that the oppressive policies and expectations of both the state and federal level have put so many of us in a position that in order to increase learning gains, we end up breaking up elementary classes by subject areas like middle school. We spend more time thinking about the parts rather than the whole. \nI know it is easier.\nAs a lifetime elementary practitioner? \nI wonder what 'the best' looks like in this landscape. \nCan an old school teacher shift to this new trajectory permanently?\nI don't know.\nMaybe it's a season for change.\nI know imma be in education.\nI'm gonna be in a brick and mortar school. I'm not ready to let that go, yet.\nBut...maybe...what if it's time to start thinking about a new path.\n\u2764\ufe0f", "total_engagement": 595, "engagement_rate": 0.01763276434329066, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-17T22:07:20.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "mine", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "season", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "class", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "expectations", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "someone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "landscape", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "state", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "school", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "narrative", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "order", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "position", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "partner", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "math & science", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "level", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teachers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "school", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "many", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bunch", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "comfort", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Education & Career", "confidence": 0.9560339450836182}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132062640775, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:25.134Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:25.134Z"}, {"id": 607775132062640772, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "757351100", "created_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:25.130Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:25.130Z"}, {"id": 607775132188536015, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T09:27:17.161Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T23:57:42.626Z"}, {"id": 607775132188536017, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-22T09:27:17.167Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T23:57:42.632Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175200241371, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CrPgC2pMm9f/", "post_id": "3084825203372617567", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "People love to say \"Build Relationships\".

This teacher's shortage means you interview *them* while they interview you. \nGo where you feel like you will GROW.\nStay where you feel whole and well.\nDon't give up on this career if you felt it was for you in August, but now you just want to run.\nGive yourself the chance yo try a new grade level, a new school, a new District, something outside of the classroom but still within education, go get a Master's.\nFight for this if it is what you want.\nAfter 26 years?\nIt is still worth it.\nI am glad I stayed even though there were times I felt just about pushed out.\nAfter all, had I left...would you be able to learn from me in the ways in which you have?\nI am glad I stayed.\nEven if it was just for you that read this far and were encouraged to press on.\nSending you love this weekend! \u2764\ufe0f", "total_engagement": 1197, "engagement_rate": 0.03547297297297297, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-30T15:51:22.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "teachers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ways", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "plates", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "anxiety", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "education spaces", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "classrooms", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tension", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "education", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "kids", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Education & Career", "confidence": 0.9532908797264099}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132062640906, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:25.873Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:25.873Z"}, {"id": 607775132062640902, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-884869865", "created_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:25.870Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:25.870Z"}, {"id": 607775132188536095, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T09:27:17.477Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T23:57:42.939Z"}, {"id": 607775132188536098, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-08-22T09:27:17.484Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T23:57:42.956Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175200241349, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CrxPTTYsSeE/", "post_id": "3094321716163323780", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "As a union leader in my district, there are a lot of things going on in Florida that just gut me right now.

As if our sole value to a space is contained in how well we move students. Moving students who have always been effective at testing feels different than what is done to help students who have been demoralized by those same tests. Moving students who are two to three years behind in one year is a skill, and those who do it consistently deserve respect.

I am sure there is some level of expectation on outcomes since I have had them for two years, but this year was so hard for us on so many levels. I am reminding myself that worrying now is just going to make me seem nervous to them, and they need my unwavering confidence and unconditional love more than ever.\n\nI wish we could all say we didn't care...this doesn't matter...it's just 'one test'.

Then, with those realizations, begin to think about the goals that you have for yourself and your students that value your humanity and celebrate your growth.\nEnjoy your summer! \ud83c\udf4e\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe", "total_engagement": 219, "engagement_rate": 0.006490042674253201, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-27T01:07:41.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "number one", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "team", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "love", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "quote", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tips", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "laughter", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "testing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reason", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "students", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teachers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "cups", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "song", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ways", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goals", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "folks", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "creativity", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teacherleaders", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "elena aguilar", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "the art of teaching teams", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mentoring group", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132062641304, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:27.453Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:27.453Z"}, {"id": 607775132062641299, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-48422732", "created_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:27.450Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T17:46:27.450Z"}, {"id": 607775132188536299, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T09:27:18.113Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T23:57:43.620Z"}, {"id": 607775132188536303, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-08-22T09:27:18.124Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-02T23:57:43.628Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175225968573, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Ct_kVx1Ok74/", "post_id": "3134383691962928888", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "Latergram: Girls Weekend \nSo thankful for my support system. \u2764\ufe0f\nWhat a year!

We align those goals to our evaluation tool and monitor progress on them with data. We call ours a DPP.  Got something like this where you are too? What's yours called?\nWe have had this tool for a while, and a lot of things on it I have used... some multiple times just because I liked working on that. Interestingly enough, one I haven't done on our tool is support for multilingual learners. I have done lots of different things, but it was never my professional focus for a year.\nSometimes, it's easy to get bogged down in all the things that are tough about being a classroom teacher in Florida. It's hard to wrestle with all the things that feel as if they have been stripped away. \nIn this professional goal, I am continuing to commit not only to elements of my personal culture being centered in my reading, thinking and doing, but I can be a stronger advocate for the students I serve in a challenging and complex time. This year, one improvement I am working on is turning my vocabulary wall into one that has both a visual and Spanish translation. Shout out to my mom, who helps me a ton with this! I am going over the words before putting them up and looking for cognates as much as possible. My multilingual learners have really enjoyed this immensely and practice often. I also speak to them in both English and Spanish whenever I can. It's been great for me to gain more confidence in my ability to communicate. \nDon't let this ol' foolish way that this government wants to talk about race and culture prohibit you from learning, y'all.
