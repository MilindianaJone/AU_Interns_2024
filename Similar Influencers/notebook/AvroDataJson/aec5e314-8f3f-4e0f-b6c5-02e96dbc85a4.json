I remember the day so vividly. She was having an unrelated surgery for her colon rectal issues (not sure which of her 27 surgeries we were up to at that point). Prior to her surgery she mentioned a small lump in her breast to the doctor. He agreed to do a biopsy during the surgery to rule out breast cancer. I knew we were in trouble when 30 minutes into the surgery I heard my name over the loudspeaker. Never a good sign. I was ushered into a small room where the doctor sat me down and told me that @yulady had breast cancer. After everything we had already been through, now this! I felt so incredibly defeated. When she woke up from surgery she smiled at me and asked me how the surgery went. She could probably tell by my face alone the news was not good. I choked out the words \u201cnot so great honey, you have breast cancer.\u201d She is so strong. She touched my arm and assured me that we would get through it, together, like we do everything. \n\nFast forward to today, May 9, 2023, @yulady is cancer free! We haven\u2019t had a surgery for over 3 years. @yulady is thriving and healthy. (Finished Boston Marathon 2023 in 3:10:09 and set an unofficial world record for a female ostomate). In appreciation of all of the medical professionals (especially the Nurses) that have carried us through we decided to do a GoFundMe for @vnahealthgroup . Of all the nurses & doctors that have helped us over these past 20 years, one organization stood out from all the rest. Visiting Nurse Association Health Group is New Jersey\u2019s largest and most trusted not-for-profit provider of home health, visiting physicians, hospice and community-based care. @vnahealthgroup was always there for us and we would like to return the favor to this amazing organization. Please help us raise money for this wonderful organization.
