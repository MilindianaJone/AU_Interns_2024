It brings me so much joy to see how far I've come, because a few months ago I received devastating news. I was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. I don't even know where to begin, but I want to share why I've been gone for so long, in hopes that at least one person is encouraged by my story. So here it goes...\n\nLast June, I was having intense vaginal bleeding. And when I say intense, I mean I was literally bleeding out. I called around and asked other women if they experienced this before and majority of them said they have. I thought, well maybe this is a \"normal\" thing that women go through. I was experiencing extreme fatigue,  weakness and just not feeling like myself. But again, I accepted this as a \"normal\" symptom that most women go through. \n\nWell, on July 1st 2022 at 4am, my husband found me in the bathroom unresponsive and not breathing. I had literally passed away. He called on Jesus to bring me back and I came back. I was rushed to the hospital, where they told me that the extreme blood loss was due to \"fibroids.\" My Gyno made it seem like it was so normal and common. I didn't think much of it, however I was passing clots the size of a placenta, which was really alarming. They kept me overnight and released me the next day. Fast forward to July 22nd, I was hospitalized again for the same thing. Again, the medical professionals treated it like it was not that alarming since it was just a \"fibroid.\"\n\nThe bleeding eventually stopped, but was replaced with labor like pains. My life became so limited. On December 31st 2022, the bleeding came back. And it would not stop. I was hospitalized again January 7th and was there for a week. I was told I could not get surgery to remove this \"fibroid\" due to my lack of blood supply. My hemoglobin level was at a 4. I had to receive 10 blood transfusions during my hospital stay. They recommended I do a biopsy. \n\n(CONTINUE READING BELOW IN THE COMMENTS \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f)", "total_engagement": 14533, "engagement_rate": 0.09904721661850499, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-07-31T19:26:48.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "cancer", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hopes", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "stage", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "husband", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "photo", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "weakness", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "photos", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "news", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "women", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "joy", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "much", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hospital", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132173545600, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-20T06:23:46.985Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-20T06:23:46.985Z"}, {"id": 607775132173545598, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1750127728", "created_at": "2023-08-20T06:23:46.980Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-20T06:23:46.980Z"}, {"id": 607775132214908322, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T11:05:58.263Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T12:48:23.582Z"}, {"id": 607775132214908324, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-08-23T11:05:58.267Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T12:48:23.588Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175236999861, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CviN2wXJ8qt/", "post_id": "3162150825751988909", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": "Los Angeles, California", "latitude": 34.0522, "longitude": -118.244}, "media": [], "post_text": "Anytime you're dealing with an illness, it not only affects you, but it also changes the lives of those closest to you. This year rocked our world. From the countless hospital stays. To the financial strain. We been through it all! The girls are too young to understand, yet they noticed the changes. They would often ask, \"when is mommy coming home?\" Or \"how come mommy keeps going in the ambulance truck?\" Being wheeled into the ambulance and waving bye to my kids, only to see them crying for their mommy to stay home, broke me. And watching my husband break down in tears, was rough.\n\nI gotta say, this was the toughest storm I have ever been through. Yet we made a commitment that we would get through this together. My husband would carry me up the stairs, carry me to the bathroom, lift me out the tub. It was hard for him to see me in that state. And I was so embarrassed to have him see me in my new body. The weight loss just made me feel like a shell of myself. I didn't want to be seen.\n\nBut we held on to our vows and the word. We moved forward and did our best not to allow current circumstances to overtake us. It was definitely not easy, but we made it this far! I no longer need assistance to do those things I needed help with before. Prayer works. Unconditional love goes a long way. This photo makes me smile, because I can see the individual happiness on each of our faces. So many new changes are happening in my life, and it's kind of scary. But I prayed for it and as long as I follow God and hold on to my family, the blessing we've been waiting for, will blow our minds!", "total_engagement": 8215, "engagement_rate": 0.05598795049343002,
