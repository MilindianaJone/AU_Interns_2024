It was -48\u00b0 and I took about a dozen photographs because I was in shock.\n\nMy nostrils were struggling to keep from freezing shut and blinking was a task. My clothes would freeze in place and to move, it felt like breaking the mold of a stiff straight jacket every other second.\n\nMy tripod legs froze and moving the camera around was near impossible. Within seconds of leaving the warm vehicle, I would re-freeze again.\n\nIn the early 1900\u2019s the Holy Lights of the North made their way to Navajoland. My great grandmother saw the lights and recounted a short story of her experience. I was a little kid and never forgot her description of it.\n\nNothing has influenced my desire to see the Holy Lights of the North more than her story. Like grandma, I have a hard time describing the lights too.\n\nTheir beauty and movement are like waves moving across the sky. Coming from the land of red earth, these colors are the opposite of what we see daily.\n\nIn 2014 we had a daughter and I named her Aurora Winter only because of my great grandmother and her story. She now carry\u2019s a Holy Light. We mostly call her Bubblegum.\n\nI cannot wait to take Bubblegum up North and have her experience and see what her great, great grandma once saw.

He was a beautiful baby boy and immediately after my prayer, I saw a shooting star. I\u2019m not sure what that means however it\u2019s part of his welcome to our lives.\n\nHe is such a beautiful boy. He is ridiculously smart with kindness unmatched. He is tremendously caring, someone to have fun with and sincere. He\u2019s never talked back, loves to help and as much as I could say about him, he makes parenting easier than I see other boys his age.\n\nI feel beyond blessed to be his father. At times we hang out like he\u2019s my little brother because I never had brothers. The fun factor is often high and though he\u2019s in 4th grade, not a day goes by where we don\u2019t get a hug from him.\n\nHis cute freckles and long eye lashes match how sweet his soul is.\n\nI cannot wait to see what he thinks when we see orcas in the wild and how luscious Iceland is. One day, we\u2019ll swim in Hawai\u2019i and most of all, continue to have more experiences than gifts.\n\nHe is Denali, the Great One. Sh\u00ed yazh, our son.

In addition to that, I was paying heavy attention to the income storm ensuring the peaks would be visible.

I don\u2019t know where my portable light box is at to view the exposures however, the snow packed mountains through my window gave plenty of light to review the gems of the past.\n\nUsing film has given me one massive advantage when it comes to photography and that is the ability to wait and most of all, appreciate the light through the various zones.\n\nI\u2019m so stoked to get organized because once that\u2019s done, I cannot wait to be behind the couple of film cameras again.\n\nThere\u2019s something unique, personal and like a gamble, hoping you were dialed. The truth of your attention and craftsmanship show only later when the film is developed and processed.\n\nThat moment is a true teacher which shows yet again, gems from a past experience.\n\nYesterday is gone.

When the sun sets for me, I will meet them there.\n\u2028It is incredible how little a star is when compared to the space it occupies. It only inhabits a minuscule  piece of space amidst the Heaven\u2019s. Likewise, a little bit of light in a home can illuminate a home and one\u2019s soul.\n\nI once pledged to find (creative) ways to power every single home so that our people can use that power to improve their lives, especially the youth who are the future problem solvers.\n\nAs much as that is a considerable goal, we continue to proceed with @goalzero and @heartofamerica to address education equity. Our partnerships are growing with others who have a similar vision. In short, I can\u2019t wait to share what we\u2019ll be doing in March and thereafter.\n\nFor now, we continue to #PowerAnythingAnywhere and when the lights are combined, they seem to be as stunning, moving and beautiful like the Milky Way. Just like the Holy One who once placed the corn pollen in the Heaven\u2019s long ago, there is a path on Mother Earth and a the reminder is above in Father Sky.\n\u2028As we wrap up this year, may you plan the path you want to walk in the next.

during Christmas. I was a kid and so antsy to rip open a few gifts. I recall sitting there in agony, impatient and hoping he would be done any second.\n\nThen he started to thank the Creator for the plants, wildlife, the creatures that crawl, the birds that fly, those living in the water and the things like shrubs and wild grass which fed our animals.\n\nLater that day I asked him why he thought of praying for so many things and he responded that there\u2019s a lot that goes into things like trees and during Christmas we should remember all that goes into what we have under the tree during this season.\n\nOver the last couple of years we\u2019ve shifted away from having a lot of gifts and having more experiences. We\u2019re still pursuing this goal and we\u2019ve had so many more memories than things rotting away.\n\nWhile leaving for our Christmas breakfast this morning, I saw a hawk sitting and resting. I immediately said \u201cAho Grandpa! Merry Christmas!!\u201d and I cried a little.\n\nI\u2019m grateful for the many Christmas\u2019 I\u2019ve had. There were plenty with little gifts and a few where jobs were well had throughout the year.\n\nAs I look back now I better understand what gratitude meant to grandpa. They were well defined in his long prayers.

hurricane.\n\nVancouver, Baltimore and Red Mesa were meaningful by helping students have better resources for their education.\n\nBuying and using an electric truck to install solar kits across Navajoland was wild which heightened the lack of infrastructure.\n\nIt seems every day became more valuable than ever before.\n\nI have many people to thank, especially my wife Lauren for continuing to believe in me. Denali for how helpful he is and Bubblegum for being the life of the party!\n\nI want to thank you as well. I\u2019m grateful this app allows me to share what I think is important, critical and at times, silly.\n\nI am so grateful for my brand partners for their support, paychecks and friendships!\n\nWe all have a story of some kind to tell and I want to thank you for following along with mine.\n\n2023 will be filled with building our two cabins, more experiences with our kids, loving deeper and realizing even more at some point I will end up 6 feet below ground. I have a few things I want our kids to remember for the rest of their lives and my goal is to live longer than my grandpa who lived through 104 winters.\n\nThank You for being part of this year. May you solve more problems and develop or strengthen your character to help more people. I will too\u2026\n\nAh\u00e9hee\u2019 \u2014 Thank You \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd", "total_engagement": 642, "engagement_rate": 0.018244337719173605, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-31T20:13:48.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "grandpa", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "brand partners", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lauren", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "resources", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "banff", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "josh", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "app", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "kids", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "kits", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "students", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "iceland", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lack", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "truck", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "commitment", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132052256775, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:10.873Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:10.873Z"}, {"id": 607775132052256773, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1757992378", "created_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:10.870Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:10.870Z"}, {"id": 607775132196695200, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T17:31:09.433Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T06:19:46.251Z"}, {"id": 607775132196695204, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-22T17:31:09.441Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T06:19:46.257Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175121887011, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm9G2lgLUsY/", "post_id": "3007590265552456472", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/83a27da0aadec55e67b806afbceb7f53.JPEG", "phash": "da55d40dbd12253d", "image_entities": [{"entity": "animal", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8257901072502136}, {"entity": "black-and-white", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5391640663146973}, {"entity": "carnivore", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.45439866185188293}, {"entity": "felidae", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4299297034740448}, {"entity": "mammal", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3583453893661499}, {"entity": "husky", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3110902011394501}, {"entity": "pet", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2648029625415802}, {"entity": "wildlife", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22805804014205933}, {"entity": "staircase", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8808934092521667}, {"entity": "cat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7665290236473083}, {"entity": "sheep", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5805730819702148}, {"entity": "gate", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24329163134098053}, {"entity": "animal", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2247108370065689}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T18:20:22.297Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-21T18:19:26.352Z"}}], "post_text": "\u2014 Outfoxed\n\nI vividly remember sitting in 2nd grade escaping a tough day in boarding school through a book about foxes. I sat wanting nothing but to be home with my family just like I read in the book.\n\nNot long ago I heard the boarding school was being torn down. I was happy because I wanted some memories of abuse, neglect and punishment buried with the building and in addition to that, I was saddened because of the great times there.\n\nHearing late news of the construction crew on-site, I left Salt Lake City and drove the 854 mile round trip to generate some photos of my childhood days.\n\nWhile there, my memory without any mishap took me directly to that 2nd grade classroom. Oddly, the entire school was quiet and a few teachers were fixing their rooms.\n\nMiraculously, I found the same book on foxes and my childhood pencil drawings of a heart were still in the book.\n\nI asked to buy the very book I held 30+ years ago for $5. I was told it was \u201cschool property\u201d. After multiple wagers, I asked if $250 would be fine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s government property\u201d and can\u2019t be purchased. I was outfoxed once more. Fortunately I was allowed to move a desk in the same orientation my childhood chair was in and I took a photo holding my favorite book of my youth. (Swipe)\n\nOne day I will get a stunning photograph of a fox. I simply know I will because the fluffy, nimble creature helped me escape mentally, while other kids physically ran away or tried to run home. Unfortunately I had incorrect settings of this fox from a recent trip.

I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s still on my iMac after it\u2019s been moved multiple times. I guess good words stick with you for a while.\n\nAs time continues to tick away, another variation has come of those short however yet powerful words.\n\nAt some point in the recent few years, the realization of moving into the next world hit me and has never gone away. It too reminds me of the endless ticking of Father Time.\n\nThat reality check has then spiraled into greater happiness, an increase in creativity and above all, additional (abundant) time with my wife, Denali and Bubblegum.\n\nThe sticky note reads \u201cDo the things you normally wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWithin one week of moving into our new home, I turned on my iMac more than I did all of last year. The previous basement office felt like a dungeon and it was the last place I wanted to be to get my writing, photography edits, new projects and potential ideas off the ground. Yet, I invaded the comfy living room couch and kitchen table which weren\u2019t the place for photography gear, hard drives, zoom meetings and the plethora of USBC cables.\n\nThere are a few things I don\u2019t like doing and moving is one of them. Fortunately we\u2019re near the tail end of having a somewhat organized home. Moving has also spawned a variation of the OG sticky note.\n\n\u201cDo the things you don\u2019t want to do as fast as possible so you can play as much as possible.\u201d\n\nLately, I\u2019ve been biking a bit more because something fun, important and quite challenging is happening in April. I\u2019m grateful that sticky note hung around and has been the secret sauce to my best days and what I believe will be the most meaningful year of my life.\n\n@thule @thule_adventure

I wore regular shorts, running shoes and rode in a mountain bike helmet. That was last year\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve since bought appropriate gear and that\u2019s made a massive improvement in enjoying the ride. That first day we went for a 42 mile stroll and I was stiff as a board for the next 3 days! It was hilarious to try and walk up or down the stairs!!\n\nIn April of last year Josh (@7tenths) and I bike packed 400 miles to raise money for a non-profit, camp and enjoy all that come with biking across the land with a little uncertainty.\n\nOne thing I take everywhere is one of my @GoalZero batteries. We have one in our kitchen, each vehicle and I always pack my Sherpa 100AC on flights.\n\nI love the Venture 35 & 75 because both are waterproof, have built in LED Lights and when biking 40, 100 or 400+ miles, they pack really well and recharge all I need.\n\nI\u2019m now building out my fat bike to bike pack into the mountains for a couple days. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve never done and it\u2019s constantly on my mind because I think I\u2019ll see so many beautiful things.

Visually, maybe it gave one last look to where it came from as it meanders forward into the great unknown.\n\nThough much of the work I\u2019ve created has been solo, I\u2019m so excited about sharing with you tomorrow something I\u2019ve been working on.\n\nAs much as it may be simple and providing a more formal presence, it took a lot of work all alone.\n\nTomorrow at 9am MTN I\u2019ll share with you what I\u2019ve been working on.\n\nI hope it\u2019s a reminder to check off something from your to do list and better yet, another example of doing the things you normally wouldn\u2019t\u2026 in my case, 3-4 years!\n\n#Wolf #Trailblazer #Monochrome", "total_engagement": 307, "engagement_rate": 0.008724317258234107, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-18T22:14:00.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "projects", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ideas", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "health", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reminder", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "participant", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "point", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "monochrome"}, {"name": "trailblazer"}, {"name": "wolf"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132052257068, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:11.639Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:11.639Z"}, {"id": 607775132052257066, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "526470513", "created_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:11.635Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:11.635Z"}, {"id": 607775132196695302, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T17:31:09.664Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T06:19:46.365Z"}, {"id": 607775132196695305, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-22T17:31:09.680Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T06:19:46.369Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175142058631, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CnmlaWtrlOP/", "post_id": "3019265139014521743", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/b27c0bd7f7e2135b38e390bf53bd4fc3.JPEG", "phash": "c63c79b2cce32c19", "image_entities": [{"entity": "flower", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.696837306022644}, {"entity": "petal", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4729095697402954}, {"entity": "baseball cap", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4573701322078705}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3444913327693939}, {"entity": "bird", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.25148579478263855}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T20:52:28.767Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-21T18:19:36.916Z"}}], "post_text": "\u2013 Take 20\n\nI\u2019m beyond happy to share my new website with you at www.mylofowler.com which is now live. I\u2019ve gone through countless photographs from the past 20+ years and selected some of my favorites and I\u2019m doing my first ever 20% off sale! (Use code: \u201cTAKE20\u201d at checkout)\n\nI\u2019ve never discounted my work in the past because I would use proceeds from the orders to do my humanitarian work. Every dollar matters when powering more homes.\n\u2028Having a website for the past couple of years rotting away like a banana was always an eyesore!\n\nI was recently asked what I enjoy about photography. There are some monumental aspects of it. It does provide for my family and if you\u2019ve ever bought anything, I cannot say thank you enough.\u2028\u2028One joy I always get is seeing photographs of mine hanging in places around the world. I find no greater satisfaction of the craft than seeing the end result find a new home.\u2028\u2028I started learning how to make prints in the darkroom long before ink jets, light jets and the digital aspect. Seeing a handmade print come to life is an absolute testament of the craft.\n\nWith the advancements of technology, I\u2019ve taken what I learned in the darkroom, past mistakes and love how it has streamlined the process from ordering to delivery.\n\nSo if I\u2019m in Iceland, riding our horse or on a photography assignment and you make an order, @smugmug will take care of you and your order will be shipped in a matter of days even while I\u2019m doing other things.\u2028\u2028If you\u2019ve ever wanted a print of mine, use the code \u201cTAKE20\u201d at checkout to receive 20% off.

the Silver Lining\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt I\u2019ve got my (fair) share of responsibilities, goals and head trash where at times, I wonder if I\u2019ll ever make it out or achieve what I\u2019d like.\n\nWhen looking for this image, the only file of it existed on an old PC computer I was using in 2015. After a million tries on the password path, I struck gold! I was able to login and see a lot of my work from the early years. No need to the thoughts, recommendations and comments about backing up my work. Done.\n\nThrough that process, I recalled the scientific evolution of how WD-40 was born. Hint, 39 formulas didn\u2019t work to displace water.\n\nI thought about the somewhat common quote of Edison \u201cOur greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.\u201d\n\nI love personal development audio books, podcasts and literature. If you\u2019re in the mood, I highly recommend both of @davidgoggins books. If you can stomach the brutal truth of where you\u2019re at, you\u2019ll run through a wall!\n\nI\u2019m so glad I came across @edmylett - I have his books and his latest one titled \u201cThe Power of One More\u201d is immensely moving.\n\nWhile finding this exposure in my files of old, it\u2019s probably one of the best experiences I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nIt is absolutely amazing how beautiful even just a sliver of light is. Maybe in the real contrast of life sometimes surrounded by darkness, hot damn\u2026 a little bit of light makes a beautiful difference.\n\nThere are many examples of those who gave it just one more try. Ask your parents, especially your grandparents. You may not find greater motivation from many than from those of who you come from.\n\nThis photograph reminds me most of how much a little light can change it all. Now, go kick some major ass!\n\nI included this image in my new website where you can still get 20% off til Sunday by using the code \u201cTAKE20\u201d \u2014 discount code only usable at www.MyloFowler.com\n\nPlease don\u2019t give up whatever is challenging you!

Many gyms are packed as basketball games are going on and fans go nuts for their teams. Most teams and fans are often from really small communities.\n\nWith somewhat of the isolation and rural life, each member of the community is important and also seams to be known by all. Greetings take place as family and friends meet\u2026 so much happens around sports. It is quite uplifting to see the word K\u00e9 live in a beautiful way.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is some schools, families, facilities have a head start which I believe is ok.\n\nThat makes the drive to compete even more meaningful and even more rewarding, when kids from a reservation or from the middle of nowhere, accomplish what they do.\n\nThe process is always a damn fight for Indigenous youth and families. To compete, play at competitive levels, and to fit into the social community under the Heavens.\n\nI share these insights with our family so we can understand how much of a privilege we have, that one leg up.\n\nWhile waking up and facing East, I pray I may use my day to help someone. Quite oddly, I\u2019ve also heard similar prayers coming from those that have had very little.\n\nAmidst not having much, deep in their hearts they had all the room, more immense than space itself, to love, lift and share.\n\n\u201cToday, I will walk out. Everything unnecessary will leave me. With beauty all around me, may I walk\u2026\u201d\n\nThe prayers of my grandparents have become mine. Their way is simple, profound and peculiar. Today I got up, faced the East. Tomorrow, I hope to do it again.\n\nOverlanding is beyond having a cool truck and gear to be in remote places. It\u2019s how I deepen my roots which began when a piece of my umbilical cord was placed back in the earth the day I was born.\n\nThis connection to our Holy Mother Earth is key and what I seek.

The authors, illustrations and writings are Indigenous People.\n\nWhile in awe of all the contents of the education pack I paused for a moment and reflected back on my favorite childhood book of my youth.\n\nThe book was about foxes.\n\nSeveral years ago I got wind that the school I was in was going to be demolished and parts of it were going to be updated.\n\nI left our home in Salt Lake and made the 16 hour round trip. My hope was I could find my classrooms and take some photos.\n\nThe Saturday was quiet and then from some kind of stored memory I walked right into my second grade class.\n\nThe old red dictionaries were STILL being used and familiar posters were still hanging. I then asked the teacher if she had any books about animals.\n\nShe guided me to a half dozen books and like a miracle, I found my favorite book.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a copy. It was the actual book I drew two hearts in. The larger heart represented my mother and the smaller one was for lil Mylo.\n\nI asked if I could purchase the book and was declined because \u201cit\u2019s government property\u2026\u201d \u2014 I was shocked so I asked if I could take a photo of myself holding the book (swipe).\n\nAfter 20+ years, there was no way I could buy the book that was my escape. Boarding school had its great and terrible moments.\n\nThe book about foxes got my mind to wonder and day dream of a better place to be.\n\nSince picking up a camera, I\u2019ve seen a few foxes in absolute rural Alaska, Yellowstone and back home. My family will tell you I\u2019ve made many trips to simply set out and return with a few exposures.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until today I was able to take the photographs I\u2019ve always wanted!!\n\nThe meaning is sooo deeply rooted and gosh, they remind me of how much healing can be found and experienced in nature.\n\nI\u2019ve added two of these images to my website.

Quite gloomy and not so vibrant. I enjoyed the constant drizzle of rain we\u2019ve been getting overnight. With the power going out for a few hours late last night while restarting Ted Lasso, many options were eliminated and the focus was turned to the simple things.\n\nI remember the first time going to bed in Huntington Beach after I moved there. I slept on the floor and woke up. I ran to CVS for some basic things like toothpaste, tp and some shower stuff.\u2028\u2028On my return people were frantic and lost. I was curious what the heck happened - the power went out.\u2028\u2028With sleeping on the floor and having no power, I was in my element while others were foreign to the experience. I lit some candles and saw the ceiling flicker away from the flame. I remember sleeping so well that night!\n\nAt the time I had about $200 to my name. I wasn\u2019t stressed because I believed big things would happen. I wasn\u2019t doing well spiritually however I made the move from Colorado to PCH following an answer to a prayer. Deciding to add a sliver of light, I began anew spiritually.\n\u2028I made a lot of friends and like usual, kept a couple close to the vest after many years. (Rhi Rhi, talking about you!) \n\nWhile my time in Huntington was amazing, 9/11 also took place. I recall exactly to this day where I was and the clothes I was wearing. Red Carhardt, Wolvering Steel Toed boots and my lunch too.\n\nAs I look back on some tough even dark and gloomy times, I\u2019m always amazed at how just a sliver of light can illuminate various things from my soul, apartment and now photographs.\n\u2028I\u2019m not sure how it works however the Light always comes during the tough times. What I do know is that it works. I thank the Creator for the Light, even at times when it\u2019s faint, it is profound and always casts out darkness.\n\nLast nights power outage was a good reminder to know where the light is.\n\n#PowerAnythingAnywhere @goalzero", "total_engagement": 464, "engagement_rate": 0.013185938787689335, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-15T16:53:24.000Z", "brands":

When she told me what she did, she had some tears because she was slightly afraid of what others may say.\n\nI recall kneeling down and looking her in those beautiful brown eyes, and reminding her she is smart, a friend anyone would love to have, and above all, brave for standing for what\u2019s right.\n\nI told Bubblegum her example strengthens me when we face big challenges, issues and being firm when it\u2019s time to stand up for others, especially the ones who can\u2019t speak, like nature.\n\nToday, our Tribe has a case that lands in the Supreme Court about water rights, use and management.

Today we speak for the corn, sage brush, peaches and even the Juniper.\n\nWater is used with caution due to its limited availability, contamination and distance needed to travel to obtain the water.\n\nFor so long, many who\u2019ve come after us have had the right to vote, speak, legislate and access water while we forcibly stand aside, shackled in silenced, drowning in useless Treaties.\n\nI\u2019m beyond grateful for Bubblegum reminding me to use photographs, even from an iPhone submerged in a trough of water, to speak for what is right.\n\nThe Din\u00e9 way of H\u00f3zh\u00f3, balance, is what we seek. When we speak for water, it extends far beyond us, the Holy Five Fingered People.\n\nWater Is Life \u2014 too many waste it in the West and we\u2019re coming for it. We\u2019re tired of drowning in broken promises.\n\n#ShotOniPhone", "total_engagement": 1277, "engagement_rate": 0.036289749637670864, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-20T13:28:06.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "class", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bubblegum", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "school", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "name", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "daughter", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "water", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "case", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "kids", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "home", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "story", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fun", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "girl", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "facetime", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "shotoniphone"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132052257626, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:12.976Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:12.976Z"}, {"id": 607775132052257624, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1383093062", "created_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:12.973Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:12.973Z"}, {"id": 607775132196695392, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T17:31:09.976Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T06:19:46.565Z"}, {"id": 607775132196695394, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-22T17:31:09.983Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T06:19:46.570Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175190266091, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CqqcIOxO-Kw/", "post_id": "3074393406550303408", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/4534853e547490ec96b72df93db31baf.JPEG", "phash": "e5673dad1cd218b0", "image_entities": [{"entity": "newborn", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6744793057441711}, {"entity": "baby", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6586145758628845}, {"entity": "black-and-white", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.526543140411377}, {"entity": "child", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.40461453795433044}, {"entity": "hand", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3439737558364868}, {"entity": "photograph", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2673411965370178}, {"entity": "bracelet", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.29583561420440674}, {"entity": "watch", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21469132602214813}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-04-06T15:39:35.316Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-21T18:20:00.382Z"}}], "post_text": "\u2014 Solutions\n\nI\u2019ve had a crazy busy two weeks. I drove 2,600 miles in that time and finally woke up in my own bed.\n\nOne thing I absolutely love about our nightly routine is praying more together and Bubblegum asking me to tuck her in. That involves me knocking on her door, anytime really, and asking her if it\u2019s ok to come in. Although I pay for the place, that\u2019s a line of respect I have for her abode.\n\nIt\u2019s a room where she reads, rests, draws, dreams and every once in a while, she sheds some tears.\n\nThe other night after I tucked her in, I heard some noise downstairs. We paused Ted Lasso and I walked down to find her crying about my Mother In Laws (Grandma Judy) situation with Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nAfter another 20 minutes of consoling and another prayer, she dozed off. The day before, Denali and I shed quite a few tears before and during dinner as I poured my soul out for grandma Judy.\n\nI hope our kids continue to have this love for others like family and friends. If you\u2019ve followed my last 2-3 weeks, you may have seen me pull out a semi and 40+ vehicles. In addition to that, we got to power 30 more homes using @goalzero solar kits.\n\nOften the cameras aren\u2019t rolling and when they are, I hope you see I\u2019ve found my own way to live my paternal great grandmother\u2019s sacred words which are, \u201cWe Are Each Other\u2019s Medicine.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve turned off comments on this post in hopes you\u2019ll reflect on how to help someone. I firmly believe we\u2019re a nation that is devaluing each other. I enjoy helping anyone in need.\n\nThree years ago a massive wind storm blew over thousands of trees across the Wasatch Front. The first person I helped flew a big Ol Glory \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 and 45\u2019s. That didn\u2019t stop me from dropping what I was doing to be the first to help that family and others.\n\nMay we be each other\u2019s medicine. I loved learning over the general conference weekend that \u201ccontention never leads to inspired solutions.\u201d Let\u2019s be each others solutions\u2026", "total_engagement": 722,

Every other day the battery will be dead and trying to get a jump start is hard\u2026\u201d\n\nBefore I knew what the words humanitarian, philanthropy, kindness, Good Samaritan, charitable or anything of the like, I knew our word K\u00e9.\n\nIt denotes and emphasizes the meaning of family.\n\nThere is a deeper meaning that surpasses one as a neighbor, fellow brother or sister at Church, however yet, respecting another as a member of one\u2019s family.\n\nOur Elders and the Wise Ones often have the highest reverence of a relative, which often isn\u2019t based on blood quantum or birth certificates.\n\nThe spirit of K\u00e9 is far from removing someone from their ancestral homelands, however yet, inclusive of the fold.\n\nWhen we introduce ourselves, the translation would be \u201cHello my relatives and my people.\u201d It emphasizes family, belonging, kinship, respect and many adjectives revolving around the word humanity.\n\nBeing able to return home with many supporters, students and love, we powered another 30 homes in a matter of two days.\n\nOne grandma was asking many questions with some concern. If I had politely introduced myself like I was taught, her concerns may have dissipated.\n\nMinutes prior to leaving she said in our language \u201cWe are of the Edgewater Clan. We\u2019ve lived here for many Winters\u2026\u201d and thinking I misheard her, I kindly asked her to repeat herself. She did and I said \u201cI\u2019m Edgewater too.\u201d\n\nHer posture transformed and she shook my hand and not letting go, she said \u201cMy little brother. Thank you for visiting us and helping my grandchildren with their education.\u201d \n\nThank goodness for K\u00e9. Without it, would the work be as meaningful?\n\nThis work wouldn\u2019t be possible without @heartofamerica @solvenergy @skipthegridcalpoly @goalzero\n\nI told the grandma that the CalPoly students

night I rewound the clock to 6 years ago. The cherry tree blossoms lined every street. With a slight scare of snow and rain making its presence known, it fell during our break.\n\nSpending a few hours inside the Provo City Center Temple, our marriage was blessed to last beyond this life.\n\nI recalled my family, our friends, food, photos and the fun! The numerous comments about our insane DJ from Arizona and photographer!\n\nThe night was set with my dream girl. She danced and I wiggled because I have absolutely zero moves lol, I could not stop smiling knowing the life I want was beginning. This photo was taken on our outtro of the wedding party I wished didn\u2019t have to end!\n\nRunning to the truck, hand in hand, we got in and I remember to this day, with absolute clarity, looking over at Lauren as she was getting in. She had this fire and twinkle in her eyes and smile. It was sooo hot! And I felt lucky to know I\u2019d see that every day after.\n\nWe spent a couple nights at Little America then 10 incredible days in my favorite big city, Paris.\n\nI can write so much more about our wedding day from 6 years ago, however, I thought heavily about the root word to companion, which is comp.\n\nIt is also the root to compelling, competition, compassion, compatible, competent, composed, complicate, complex\u2026about comp, I could go on and on too.\n\nAbove all, comp means to fill.\n\nAs much as marriage is a selfish fulfillment of what one wants or needs, ours was unique because my thoughts were beyond myself which included Denali and Bubblegum.\n\nLast night at dinner I told the kids I accidentally shattered moms rear taillight. In an instant, I got \u201cthe look\u201d from Bubblegum and a gentle kick to the shin \ud83d\ude06 \n\nI loved that because that showed me Gum is looking out for mom. Denali has expressed his love for Lauren in other ways too. It\u2019s all cute!\n\nI\u2019m so grateful for Lauren. She makes my life meaningful. She is my best friend, business consultant, assistant attorney, DJ, dance partner, Rivian shredder, camera assistant, concert goer, travel agent\u2026\n\nShe\u2019s the greatest human to ever exist full of love, creative, kind, thoughtful and fills my life perfectly!\n\n\ud83d\udc95 @meetthefowlers \ud83d\udc95", "total_engagement": 1551, "engagement_rate": 0.044076273835573616, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-21T15:52:46.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lauren", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "clock", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rain", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "dj", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "marriage", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "presence", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "street", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "snow", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "meetthefowlers"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132052257783, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:13.299Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:13.299Z"}, {"id": 607775132052257782, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "325272648", "created_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:13.294Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:13.294Z"}, {"id": 607775132196695424, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T17:31:10.080Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-04T05:39:14.031Z"}, {"id": 607775132196695428, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-22T17:31:10.086Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-04T05:39:14.038Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175200342251, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CroFmyELC7S/", "post_id": "3091745799519612626", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/67c73708e6094c1d5841993c1e5e3303.JPEG", "phash": "8484bf7f6410daa7", "image_entities": [{"entity": "badlands", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9858539700508118}, {"entity": "canyon", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9309883117675781}, {"entity": "formation", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9151403307914734}, {"entity": "escarpment", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7472156286239624}, {"entity": "geology", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6341606974601746}, {"entity": "natural landscape", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5948862433433533}, {"entity": "nature", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5911203622817993}, {"entity": "outdoors", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.47718343138694763}, {"entity": "national park", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4678182303905487}, {"entity": "rock", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2773760259151459}, {"entity": "sky", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2438407987356186}, {"entity": "valley", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22053687274456024}, {"entity": "painting", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7596399188041687}, {"entity": "staircase", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5693372488021851}, {"entity": "rug", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23396675288677216}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-05-05T10:54:43.697Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-21T18:20:11.470Z"}}], "post_text": "\u2014 Grand Entry\n\nBubblegum recently gave a talk about miracles. She asked for more details about a few I\u2019ve had on road trips, in Southern France as a Mormon Missionary and others in the red rocks of the Southwest, especially back home on Navajoland.\n\nI recall going to bed early due to a long day of work in the sun as a photography guide. Then around 2:15am I woke up in haste.\n\nMy vision was so clear that standing on a ledge to feel the updraft of the morning brisk air woke me in my sleep. I also saw the stunning colors of dawn.\n\nThe dream was as if I was there. I dwelt on those thoughts so much that I prayed for clarification.\n\nFollowing the prompting, I packed my cheap tent and camera gear. Running low on 4x5 large format film, I only packed one holder loaded with film on each side.\n\nOff I went with two chances.\n\nMy friend and I camped and we spent the evening talking away in our language. Laughing and eating some frybread with mutton ribs, the temperature began to drop as the stars began to rise.\n\nMesmerized, a shooting star lit the night and the soft wind picked up. Snuggling deeper into my sleeping bag, I fell asleep.\n\nA 5am piss break woke me up and I opened my tent to a layer of fresh powder\u2026 it snowed!\n\nI wondered how and above all, I didn\u2019t see any headlights or trails of dust below in the valley.\n\nA phone call later would confirm the muddy roads required canceling school and tours.\n\nThe valley was quiet, cleaned of any floating particle and I was above it all on a ledge underneath the dark cloth waiting to start counting\u2026 one one thousand, two one thousand\u2026\n\nEight seconds later, the panoramic print Grand Entry was created on film.\n\nThe title of the photograph reflects on the beautiful, vivid morning I saw in my dream only the night before.\n\nAfter the aperture closed on my lens I reflected deeper on the Grand Entry I made into this, the Glittering World, a time ago.\n\nMy dear mother was all alone.

With the massive winter we\u2019ve had, the first 50 miles would have sunk us.\n\nLast year Josh got a flat within 3 seconds of starting our bike ride and we had about 250 miles of non-stop headwind.\n\nThere are so many ups and downs on this bike packing trip that through it all, it\u2019s still so much fun!!\n\nAs we\u2019ve had many summits to stand on and yell from, the rewards of a little suck time is all worth it.\n\nBiking has opened many new doors and opportunities. In addition to that, using it as a way to make a difference.\n\nOur goal is to power over 30 more homes this year from the donations generated from this ride.\n\nI\u2019ve had many projects where a massive difference has been made from the collective of small donations.\n\nIf you can, donate at the link in my bio. You\u2019re support means more students will have power, light and educational tools to further their education.\n\nAnd you can win some really, really cool items our partners are giving away. I\u2019m so stoked about the Grand Prize!!\n\nAgain, thank you and find all the details at the link in my bio.\n\nMaking a difference is what brings me the most joy.\n\n@heartofamerica @thule

the expanse of my gratitude and love for my sweet mother in law, Judy. From her life of much giving, I am lucky and fortunate to see the effect of motherhood blossom in one of her own, my wife Lauren. For that, my thanks to Judy may forever be immeasurable.\n\nCrossing beyond tens of thousands of people, Judy was unique with an absolute heavenly beam in every smile. It\u2019s all one could possibly define in the twinkle of her eyes.\n\nJudy set the bar of how much her children meant to her. I am ever glad Denali, Bubblegum and I got to become grafted into her family tree. We will forever remember her love and heart so pure.\n\nWhen dating Lauren I mentioned how much I adored the love she had for her sweet mother. It was genuine, unwavering and consistently shown.\n\nAfter being engaged, I remember saying to Judy \u201cI can\u2019t wait to marry your daughter Lauren\u201d. She smiled and was so happy for her. In that was an unspoken lesson to also do all that I can for Lauren to be happy and loved.\n\nFor such a soul like Judy many were in the presence of Heaven\u2019s Light. At least I felt that way\u2026\n\nI can only see the Angel\u2019s above delicately ushering her into the World of Great Spirits. For Greatness she was, a beautiful Spirit she now is.\n\nAt some point in our journey, we will see you again. Until then Judy, know I will love your baby girl with all my heart, still, a bar you set ever high. A lifelong worthy pursuit to resemble what you gave to your family.\n\nYour faith, well fortified by words, action and music praise your Maker. Your exemplary life to follow Him can only grant you easier access into the Highest of eternity.\n\nWe hope to love and give as you did. Rest well, our sweet girl. Rest from your beautiful Journey.\n\n@meetthefowlers \ud83d\udc95", "total_engagement": 533, "engagement_rate": 0.01514677882292762, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-29T15:31:39.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lauren", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "law", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "love", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "judy", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "effect", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "gratitude", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mother", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [{"name": "meetthefowlers"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132052258243, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:14.263Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:14.263Z"}, {"id": 607775132052258242, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1457845521", "created_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:14.260Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-03T05:24:14.260Z"}, {"id": 607775132196695502, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-22T17:31:10.336Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T06:19:46.745Z"}, {"id": 607775132196695503, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-08-22T17:31:10.344Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-25T06:19:46.751Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175220819470, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Ct0bXHCNE5k/", "post_id": "3131247976286277220", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/eda33091f52000ac1b8e15a748d42670.JPEG", "phash": "88f7e5881e73618e", "image_entities": [{"entity": "ecoregion", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7582111954689026}, {"entity": "grassland", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5116590857505798}, {"entity": "horse", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4692838191986084}, {"entity": "mammal", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.43841615319252014}, {"entity": "natural environment", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.43201616406440735}, {"entity": "sky", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3551965653896332}, {"entity": "mare", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3351321816444397}, {"entity": "mustang horse", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2534162700176239}, {"entity": "wildlife", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.25014349818229675}, {"entity": "stallion", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21243885159492493}, {"entity": "horse", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9805384874343872}, {"entity": "bicycle", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9733640551567078}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9307237863540649}, {"entity": "bicycle", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8286918997764587}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7651135921478271}, {"entity": "cow", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6580654382705688}, {"entity": "cattle", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.38736388087272644}, {"entity": "horse", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.34822878241539}, {"entity": "cow", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2552209794521332}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-06-28T11:36:04.024Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-21T18:20:22.540Z"}}], "post_text": "\u2014 Savoring Joy\n\nI woke up in Austria this morning. A beautiful thunderstorm showered the already rich, green land with much more moisture.\n\nAs the low laying clouds wisp away, massive mountains begin to appear in the distance. They are substantially different than the mountains we see from our deck in Utah.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking heavily about using my time doing meaningful work. Work that moves the needle of purpose. These thoughts come from reading the eulogy of my dear sweet mother in law. She was definitely a mountain of joy, always had time for you and went about doing good!\n\nI am quite excited about today because my new film will premiere at Crankworx and I cannot wait for you to see it too.\n\nThose close to me know the story has been in the works for a couple years. As I sit here at 5am in thought about today hearing the rainstorm, I am moved by seeing the consistent movement of water.\n\nAt times we may be a creek moving at a slow trickle or rushing down a canyon forming powerful rapids. Lately, I\u2019ve felt like water in a pond or lake, dammed by something and stagnant. While pondering the visual, I realized that ponds and lakes, although not moving hastily downstream, provide a habitat, fauna, home and nutrients for various life forms above and below water.\n\nEventually, the universe and gravity will allow the water to break free and continue the journey.\n\nI feel today, the dam will no longer hold me back and it\u2019s time to get back to work helping those in need. It\u2019s the only way I feel to live doing meaningful work with joy.\n\nI\u2019d like to thank @thule for their incredible support in bringing this film to life! The story is a beautiful one about movement \u2014 456 miles of it!\n\nFeaturing: Myself & @7tenths \nFilmed by: @benweiland & @bobcatdavis \nEdited by: @bobcatdavis \nAudio/Mix: @scottmiddough

Recharge\n\nSince the beginning of May I\u2019ve been on the go. It stared with a 450 mile bike ride and a one day break before rolling right into one of my favorite events of the year, Overland Expo West in Flagstaff, AZ.\n\nAfter that and another one day break, we then took off to Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Southern Sweden.\n\nThe anticipated two week trip was shortened to 4 days as we came home to be with family.\n\nAfter, we rolled right into the Outdoor Adventure X event in Utah. Another one day break and I left solo to Innsbruck, Austria while the rest of the Fowler crew was at the family reunion.\n\nA lot has happened since the beginning of May and I\u2019m so grateful I\u2019m the chaos, some planned and some not, I\u2019ve never had to worry about powering my devices using my @goalzero Venture 35, 75 and Sherpa 100AC.\n\nThese are my favorite portable battery systems to use on trips near and far!!\n\nA true testament to #PowerAnythingAnywhere whether I\u2019m in the desert, on a train straddling Germany and Austria or in the garden of a castle!\n\nAs much as I\u2019ve got power to recharge my gear, I also take time to recharge who I am amidst the fun schedule!!", "total_engagement": 312, "engagement_rate": 0.00886640711586007, "network_type":

couple years ago Lauren and I spent nearly a month all over Europe in the mountains and hillsides of Switzerland, Austria, Bavaria and nearby cities. It was a trip to remember and our gratitude for it increased when the world shut down.\n\nWe planned to take our kids back to some of those areas including Southern France. Paris wasn\u2019t even on the radar until Bubblegum asked if there was anyway we could stop there too. So, my favorite big city was added to our travels and nearly at the last minute, we weren\u2019t able to go to Europe for 3 weeks with Denali and Bubblegum (IYKYK).\n\nWe were all quite disappointed and we began to plan another trip stateside so we left to Glacier Nat\u2019l Park.\n\nThe mountains are massive, beautiful and filled with so much Indigenous history. The glaciers are becoming smaller and the magnitude of nature delivered peace in the disappointment.\n\nWe fished, hiked, slept under the stars in our roof top tent, biked and swam in some cold water. The round trip took a week. \n\nThe last photo in this carrousel shows why one day we will return to Glacier just as much as taking the kids to Europe\u2026 one day.\n\nThis trip bonded us even more. It seems Mother Earth provides the comfort when it\u2019s most needed. We dipped our faces in the cold water four times and gave thanks to Creator for a magnificent land to meander in. The immense trees reminded me to deepen my roots and the rushing water indicated finding a way, even through things as tough as granite.\n\nThe Light was absolutely stunning! I\u2019m always amazed at how a little bit of Light can do so much as we summit and descend the mountains in life. The will within the human soul is also just as remarkable. A lesson I\u2019ve relearned during this time.

congregation the Sunday immediately following our recent trip to Montana.\n\nThe topic was \u201cWhat can we do to continue down the pathway of discipleship when life gets hard?\u201d This Friday I will be speaking to over 200 youth of my faith in Colorado. Next month I\u2019ll be speaking at the Santa Fe Indian School.\n\nIt is an honor to share some experiences I\u2019ve had spiritually, physically, mentally and intellectually. The last 41 Winters have shaped me to become who I am today and the rising sun gives me hope that I turn into who I want to become.\n\nI\u2019m grateful we live by mountains and are often in them. Lately, we\u2019ve been fishing in the canyons minutes from our Utah home. We saw bighorn sheep for the first time this morning. We catch and release the fish and together, we bond and weld our relationships.\n\nNot only with each other, we try to be one with the other living creatures around us.\n\nI always marvel and wonder why it took less time to create First Man and First Woman yet the rest of nature was curated over a much longer timeframe. I\u2019ve yet to receive an answer to that, however my feelings is soon, we will know the power of Mother Earth, and for some, ignorance will show a little late.\n\nGlaciers formed the steep canyons of the now famed and incredibly young naming of the National Park. I wish I could go back in time to sit and learn from the wise ones of the land.\n\nIn these mountains I prayed and pondered in hopes to feel the peak of the Great Spirit. I\u2019m fortunate to be a friend to many, even to those who hate, oppose or are baffled of the path I walk.\n\nI too once wondered and asked why this is the way. Guided by Medicine Men, I was advised to find out.\n\nLife so far has had its peaks and valleys. I love and feel like the foreground behemoth leading to a summit. I\u2019m a work in progress with the high one not yet in sight.\n\nVarious Peaks are waiting ahead. Meandering I go. The Creator allowed me to wake another day. He\u2019s not done with me, yet.

and Indigenous People of and around the Grand Canyon.\n\nI was humbled by the beautiful reverence Dianna (Havasupai) had by offering a morning prayer. We sat with her and listened. She was eloquent and profound in her message about the catastrophe of uranium, past and present.\n\nWhile we ventured into desolate lands, I thought of the word desolate. I learned that word from non Din\u00e9 or non Indigenous People. It describes where many of \u201cus\u201d were forced to live while the richness of the land was taken, stolen and harvested, only to be left like the initial photo in this series \u2014 scared.\n\nAs I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve found so much more medicine, beauty and power from the land.\n\nIn these remote areas, non functioning mines exist and continue to stand as reminders of the rush of old.\n\nUnfortunately, for many Din\u00e9, my people, their lives intersect uranium mining and are also  left with the lifelong scars of the metal.\n\nThe proposed \u201cBaaj Nwaavjo I\u2019tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument\u201d would protect these lands.\n\nFor a body isn\u2019t much without the water, cells, ligaments, arteries or organs. As such, the concern in continuing to unearth the metal could expose it to the massive drainages that flow into the lifeline of the West, the Male River. You know it as the Colorado River.

They were trying during trying times.\n\nTheir days were challenging and were inspiring each other from overcoming pills, eating disorders, drug use, alcohol consumption, time online, pornography, stealing, gambling and a few more things.\n\nI loved being there and felt absolutely out of place because I didn\u2019t have any challenges besides figuring out how to navigate life as a (recent) divorced single father.\n\nIf we felt comfortable we would introduce ourselves and talk about what we were trying to overcome that week.\n\nI\u2019d listen to people talk about their week and often they shared one thing they did to win the week to start with sobriety or how they were maintaining it. All were also part of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\n\nThough those meetings and get-together\u2019s happened 9+ year ago, I never forgot the Spirit I felt. To be candid, I\u2019ve probably felt the spirit so much more with them than other groups of people of the faith. It was unique, powerful and the range of His forgiveness was quite broad. It was oddly a strange breath of fresh air! It was meaningful to me to see how much Light was being spread to those who felt they were in the dark as castaways. To me, I felt at peace and was inspired by the sponsors and supporters. The dark place they thought they were in illuminated my world!\n\nThe grand lesson I learned was to \u201cDo the things you normally wouldn\u2019t\u201d \u2014 that could include walking away, praying, eating a bit less, turning off the internet or stepping away from friends. I was so amazed at the decisions many made to become better for it. They were so focused on The One. Whether that was their Divine Figure, the one change or improvement they wanted, I was amazed at the one thing they did differently.\n\nWhen we would meet again we would no longer be strangers yet fellow humans who were trying. The peace brought into the round circle became special to me.\n\nAfter I felt I was back on my feet, I drifted away. Today, I thought of the group.

Overall, I loved knowing sun was hitting hundreds and hundreds of solar panels back home being converted into stored power!\n\nFrom Norway to Navajoland whether on an incredible bike ride or finding solutions for students without a power source, we use @goalzero to #PowerAnythingAnywhere \u2014 great for when the storms come or even at airports when people are scrambling for a working outlet!",

Being home and thinking about the trip, still seems unreal. Like, I was legit biking in and out of fjords of Norway just a couple days ago!\n\nWhile there our conversations varied and I\u2019m still quite impressed by the fact that everything on earth, including ourselves, is in need of something else.\n\nWe\u2019re so dependent on whatever that is because without it we cease to exist.\n\nWhile looking out our dining room sliding doors, our hummingbird feeders gets occasional visitors which absolutely lighten up our day! I see the usps postman trying to fix something on his rig to deliver mostly junk mail and little important mail.\n\nThe size of the hummingbird is rather small considering their migration route into Central America.\n\nAs we look at the mountains off our deck, we see birds beginning to migrate.\n\nI\u2019m so deep in my thoughts about how much time I have left here. Time is moving quickly and soon the most celebrated holidays will be upon us and another revolution around the sun will be made.\n\nMy hope in the next 6 months is to photograph the beauty of nature in a way that all can realize how much we need the thing we do.\n\nJust as much as we seek balance, nature does too. Without us, Mother Earth would thrive - she wins because we\u2019re simply in the way.\n\nFrom the standpoint of Creation, I\u2019m always curious to mingle in my wonderings of why in the Holy text, it took more \u201cdays\u201d to create everything else and simply one for mankind.\n\nFor now, I awake simply knowing the Creator isn\u2019t done with me yet and has allowed me to also be on the move.\n\nPhoto from 2015 in Alaska.", "total_engagement": 546, "engagement_rate": 0.015516212452755123, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-09-01T17:15:00.000Z", "brands":

I learned so much in the acquiring of the equipment.\n\nI saved a few hundred bucks and splurged on a Pentax 1\u00b0 spot meter. Shortly after the purchase I began to take that tool everywhere with me. I jotted down notes on thousands of 4x6 notecards - my library!\n\nVarious specs on one side with drawings on the opposite\u2026 my approach was \u201cif I had a camera, this is how I would photograph\u201d. The portable pocket size murals gave me insight to look at compositions, settings and ideas. All prepared for the day life would transition from the \u201cif I had a camera\u201d to actually being behind one.\n\nI was not prepared to view my compositions flipped vertically and horizontally (swipe to see what I mean\u2026 that\u2019s how I saw all my compositions for many years behind my large format view cameras)\n\nAs luck would have it, after buying a 4x5, lenses, film holders and all the gear required, my trustee Pentax gave up the ghost \u2014 it stopped working right before my first photograph!\n\nFortunately, I had my countless experiences with the light of the Southwest. The ombre shadows and lively sunsets of fire, the range was stunning!\n\nThe true test came when the moment came to put playtime to rest and expose my first sheet of film, drawing from my field notes which were in a desk at home.\n\nI remember being soo thrilled in the instant, yet the process was so simple. The only sound in the vast desert was that of a 2 second shutter being released.\n\nNo magic. Simple, pure and nothing required batteries.\n\nThe season is at hand to start my photography workshops again.\n\nHelping photographers, new and experienced, is one of my favorite things to do! If you\u2019d like to join me, send me a message.\n\n*An important note. Every workshop I\u2019ve ever done has filled up.

Timeline\n\nI recently gave a talk in our home congregation about \u201cWhat Can We Do To Continue Down the Path of Discipleship When Life Gets Hard\u201d \u2014 I drew from several prominent experiences in and out of the faith.\n\nWhen hardships come by my own doing or from others, I try to take a step back and look at the moment in life.\n\nTime and challenges immediately after my divorce felt like it was never ending. I wished for the pain to flee and then through equine therapy, I realized my viewpoint had a massive impact on facing the challenging times.\n\nDrawing a parallel I reflected on a childhood science ah-ha/woah moment to realize the moment would soon flee and the night would pass.\n\nI realized the scale of issues were enlarged by my standards and that I could step back with a different lens.\n\nFor what science and math are worth (to me it was a lot) if Earth were the size of a grain of sand, the Sun would be about the size of an orange, roughly 20 feet away. This would place our entire solar system inside 4 football fields!\n\nAgain, if earth were the size of a grain of sand, the size of our Milky Way Galaxy would be over 28 million miles wide!\n\nThis makes the known universe overwhelmingly massive!!!\n\nI like this visual because it helps me understand in the timeline of my existence, the tough and hard times in my life are but a speck at most!\n\nAs I look at photographs of Bubblegum from pre 3 years old, we spent a lot of time in nature. It\u2019s where I felt the most calm and peace.\n\nIt was a tough time that now seems so long ago. The tough days too shall pass and are a fleck relative to the timeline of our existence, both physical and spiritual.\n\nWe often say if we wake up, that\u2019s a beautiful sign the Creator isn\u2019t done with us, yet.\n\nHave a wonderful week my friends.", "total_engagement": 408, "engagement_rate": 0.011594532382278554, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-09-03T22:53:50.000Z",

From migrating birds, deer, foxes and the occasional hoot at night, his hearing was acute.\n\nUnfortunately, he\u2019d ask me to ride one of his horses to where our home is now, because he could hear chainsaws, the opening of a trucks 4 barrel carburetor and essentially, someone being somewhere they shouldn\u2019t.\n\u2028Having sheep, cows, horses as a small version of a ranch with bucking shoots, he also taught me much around livestock which he oversaw for our family and eventually our community as the Grazing Committee President.\n\nEvery Summer was a blast because we branded, tagged, spayed, neutered and got western with the hot and sticky days of branding. Getting kicked in the shin by cows was the worst! Grandpa was truly the kindest and toughest!\n\nHe also took time to teach me the sounds of the animals. How to tell when they\u2019re looking for their young, in destress and the range of their emotions.\n\nDrawing on sound behind the camera, I whistled deep inside Canyon De Chelly and this mustang came running! Disappointed in seeing it was me instead of a competing stud, he stopped and we had a stair down.\n\nI remember the sounds of his hoofs and flaring of his nostrils after exhaling ricochet off the towering sandstone canyon walls.\n\nYou know where I\u2019ll be when the leaves begin to change.

It has to be used.\n\nWith the recent bike trip to Norway, I only had an hour or so to pack and catch my flight. I had the basics for my bike gear and clothes. My attitude was that if I needed something I\u2019d find it somewhere in route. I think sometimes my belief of \u201cwe\u2019ll climb over that fence when we get there\u201d either gets me in trouble or I\u2019m pushed to problem solve on the spot.\n\nBeing many miles away from the nearest and sub par store of any kind also lent to solution finding back home on Navajoland.\n\nAs I look at this photograph, I\u2019m in love with the range of light and slight grain! Aside from a striking sand dune, the main thing that drew me into the creating the composition was not the spire, dune or clouds, yet, some tracks moving from left to right of a cottontail rabbit.\n\nAfter the morning rise of the sun, I reviewed notes and felt as impressed back then as I do now, to occasionally look back at my tracks.\n\nOne can draw much from the past in creating a better future to avoid mistakes, make improvements or in my case, have a better experience.\n\nThis morning my wife and I reviewed our schedule for the next little bit.

Some never got to grow up as they\u2019ve lived in the World of Great Spirits. On Mother Earth, she has one sister and since my youth and into every new day, I called her shim\u00e1 (mother) too.\n\nWe have wonderful nieces and nephews and I love how my older sister taught them what to call her\u2026shim\u00e1 as well. Above that, she has her sons call her shim\u00e1 regardless of where they are.\n\nStealing and loving the teaching, our kids (Denali & Bubblegum) call me shizh\u00e9'\u00e9 (father) in front of their friends, at church, soccer practice and anywhere else.\n\nIn our language shizh\u00e9'\u00e9 and shim\u00e1 mean something waaaay more than simply mom and dad. Likewise, our greeting of Y\u00e1'\u00e1t'\u00e9\u00e9h could take an hour or two to fully understand how such a word has deep roots!\n\nTo be candid, I\u2019ve said more bad words this year than use the words \u201cbut\u201d and \u201cjust\u201d. In most cases I realized anything coming after the use of those words is either me defending or minimizing the context.\n\nThe words became useless several years ago when my phone rang and someone asked \u201cwho\u2019s calling you?\u201d I replied \u201cit\u2019s just my mom\u201d\u2026 \n\nFrom our Din\u00e9 teachings, I\u2019m learning more and more how powerful and beautiful certain words are. Likewise, attempting to describe the path of the Holy People of the North (that\u2019s what we call them as they\u2019re known as the Aurora Borealis), words escape and you simply have to see them. Words in describing the experience seem to be useless too.\n\nThis unique image hangs in Bubblegum\u2019s room because my great grandmother described to me how she saw the Holy Path in the early 1900\u2019s and that\u2019s why Aurora Winter is our daughter\u2019s name even though we mostly call her Bubblegum.\n\nThe Pathway is heading South and while hours above Fairbanks in -48\u00b0 weather absolutely alone, I connected with my great grandmother again. Hopefully someone made an offering and sang songs like she did for them Above\u2026 I recall sharing a few words in a prayer for Their long journey somewhere South.

I\u2019d never seen anything move so fast across the sagebrush filled sand dunes, rocks and the terrain of the land.\n\nOur family\u2019s fastest horse was an Arabian/Mustang mix however in the chaos of being spooked, even our fastest horses were in the middle or tail end of the herd!\n\nIt was an absolute riot as my imaginations of riding a horse as fast as possible were born then. After many days of chasing the wild horses including ours, we finally managed to corral about 75 horses! I\u2019d never seen something so rugged, mangled and beautiful!\n\nIt was the only way we could separate our horses from the wild ones.\n\nEarly the next morning we met at the arena only to find our horses and a blazed trail. All the horses were let out during the night. Tire tracks would indicate someone made a visit while we were snoozing away.\n\nMy grandpa was frustrated because he wanted to study the horses, their conditions and see the stallions of the herd.\n\nHe then turned to his coveted mustang Pony. Pure, wild, stern and unstoppable, I instead opted for the thoroughbred/quarter horse named Brownie.\n\nAfter nearly a week of running from us, it was time to take part in a ceremony. I\u2019ll never forget starting the ride and ending 55 miles later. Of the many horses that started, only three made it to the end. Two were grandpas and I rode one.\n\nHis tender care, study and companionship was the first time I saw loyalty. What I recall the most was his support in my hopes to ride in the ceremony.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget him saying how well I rode Brownie. From grandpa, we both received a treat. Brownie got her corn mix and I got a cold Coke with mutton stew.\n\nI\u2019m packing for my next NatGeo assignment going West. I hope to see wild horses. I\u2019ll tip my hat to them only because that\u2019s what I saw grandpa do too.", "total_engagement": 1103, "engagement_rate": 0.031345022592287365, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-09-10T03:52:08.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "grandpa", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "time", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "someone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "horses", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "horse", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "grade", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Hobbies & Lifestyle", "confidence": 0.9724248051643372}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132306290434, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-18T06:46:44.309Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-18T06:46:44.309Z"}, {"id": 607775132306290433, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "352304486", "created_at": "2023-09-18T06:46:44.274Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-18T06:46:44.274Z"}, {"id": 607775132309479161, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-19T06:24:37.335Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-02T06:49:11.946Z"}, {"id": 607775132309479162, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-09-19T06:24:37.338Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-02T06:49:11.952Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175277664434, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CxGFjt4LjcQ/", "post_id": "3190261830713751312", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/68dfaf8293a015c828d0087d947b29f9.JPEG", "phash": "b2f2648949e6da4d", "image_entities": [{"entity": "black-and-white", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9902903437614441}, {"entity": "black", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9876247644424438}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9574718475341797}, {"entity": "hairstyle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9174256324768066}, {"entity": "monochrome photography", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8640757203102112}, {"entity": "monochrome", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.496033251285553}, {"entity": "photograph", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3103324770927429}, {"entity": "white", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3038161098957062}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5003052353858948}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-19T01:25:48.014Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-28T06:24:52.044Z"}}], "post_text": "\u2014 The Wise Ones\n\nI was absolutely tired from driving for 29 hours and my older sister asked if I could take a 4 hour detour. Wanting to be home in my bed and a warm shower after being on the road to audition for \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d, I turned off and headed towards Canyon De Chelly.\n\nGetting my gear and hoping this grandma would make it in time for sunset, we were really cutting it down to the wire. The Four hour detour for less than 3 minutes of sunset light?\n\nThe truck pulled up and I was ashamed. I was embarrassed within and regretted all the grouchy feelings I had before.\n\nShe was carefully and delicately helped out of the truck with a portable step stool, family on both sides holding her hands, she sat and briefly talked about how she saw the canyon and landscape change for nearly a century.\n\nNot knowing who I\u2019d be photographing aside from \u201ca beautiful grandma\u201d, I found out just before the trucks arrival it was my older sister\u2019s biological grandmother.\n\nThat\u2019s when my heart broke. I mentioned needing to find a filter in my truck (lies\u2026), instead I wiped my tears away.\n\nThose few minutes with her are still engrained in me because that\u2019s the greatest lesson I learned in under a couple minutes with someone.\n\nSometimes that\u2019s all it takes to help them and we\u2019re often the better for it because we did something we normally wouldn\u2019t.

I got basic details of the trip and knew much planning had gone into the bike ride\u2026 that\u2019s the beauty of going somewhere with someone who\u2019s done it a ton\u2026 they probably have most of it figured out and the invitee needs to make a simple decision.\n\nMy holdup in responding was because we not only had great sales, we were returning home with a couple framed images, booth display stuff like chairs, a fridge, carpet, rugs and most of it was also in a trailer.\n\nAfter my photo shoot with Smartwool, I texted back and said \u201cI\u2019m in! Let\u2019s go!!\u201d\n\nI sent my passport info and then the planning began. Who can go to our house, grab my gravel bike, disassemble it, pack it then take it back home? This trailer\u2026 can we get rid of it half way home?\n\nCalculating charging times all resulted into a 14 hour drive, a 30 minute nap at home, a 5 minute shower and 20 minutes to pack and load up the truck to haul you know what to the airport.\n\nAs much as those are the some of the details, all I really needed to do was jump and figure things out on the way.\n\nThe result was a bike ride of a lifetime with a great, great friend and a rock solid crew! I\u2019ll never forget the people we met along the way. They know who they are \u2014 my friends.\n\nSometimes jumping is all it takes and figuring things out in route.\n\nI\u2019m now heading back to Santa Fe to deliver 3 more framed images and wondering

While in deep thought of doing more, I reflected back on those that have come with me on trips and that\u2019s when I came across these photos taken by Denali.\n\nThe world is expanding and there are plenty of incredible Indigenous artists, athletes and the like, who have the talent, craftsmanship, skill and drive.\n\nI doubt Denali\u2019s images will ever be licensed for commercial use, however I can\u2019t wait to see more work made by Indigenous artists!\n\nThat said, reach out to your favorite Indigenous photographer, painter, jeweler, PA, athlete, model, writers\u2026 We\u2019re out there and it\u2019s time to shine!\n\nPhotos 3-6 were taken by Denali \ud83d\ude0b", "total_engagement": 549, "engagement_rate": 0.0156014663673307, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-09-22T16:08:55.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132344640813, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-06T16:37:40.879Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-06T16:37:40.879Z"}, {"id": 607775132344640812, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "73242084", "created_at": "2023-10-06T16:37:40.848Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-06T16:37:40.848Z"}, {"id": 607775132374872943, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-17T08:09:51.173Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-02T06:49:12.027Z"}, {"id": 607775132374872945, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "6", "created_at": "2023-10-17T08:09:51.180Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-02T06:49:12.034Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175292913197, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CxsfYNMLMuz/", "post_id": "3201071438025771955", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/6bcbefeacdff6517136ab13cacb61a19.JPEG", "phash": "dd334498e77cc348", "image_entities": [{"entity": "astronomy", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9879779815673828}, {"entity": "atmosphere", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9066013097763062}, {"entity": "nature", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8896906971931458}, {"entity": "night", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8775884509086609}, {"entity": "outdoors", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8731643557548523}, {"entity": "outer space", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7770368456840515}, {"entity": "sky", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5435842275619507}, {"entity": "star", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5375945568084717}, {"entity": "space", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.35741397738456726}, {"entity": "universe", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3418455421924591}, {"entity": "starry sky", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.27812865376472473}, {"entity": "tent", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7849059700965881}, {"entity": "rug", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.47903046011924744}, {"entity": "painting", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20834922790527344}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-06T02:17:15.642Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-28T06:28:10.824Z"}}], "post_text": "My bearings of Navajoland used to be based on road signs, landmarks and specific points in nature.

Great Spirits, that word will come to mind.\n\nMy relationships, commitments, failings and mission in life revolve around the improvements of life for those around me and improving mine by pushing myself.\n\nOne of my greatest works will be figuring out how to bring power and light to those that are without.\n\nIt brings me so much happiness to see the families, single mothers, grandparents and family members light up at the work.\n\nWe\u2019re installing these kits faster and faster by implementing ideas from past partnerships and trips.\n\nI wish I could stay long enough to see how the families and youth use the kits. Some power chromebooks, phones, small refrigerators, light up living rooms or patios to play games, connect and improve their education together as a family.\n\nI know of a handful of families who run fans, curling irons, clippers, small tv\u2019s, starlink, modems, hot spots and robots!\n\nHow the power is used is quite diverse! I\u2019m always amazed at how the kids assist the families. One father uses it to recharge his chainsaw battery to keep his family warm as some live beyond 15 miles from the highway and even further from a store of any kind.\n\nAs I continue to make time for my own needs, my wife and our kids, I revisit the word meaningful, which also means visiting my people again and again.\n\nThis work won\u2019t stop.

This image called \u201cSweet Light\u201d is one of my favorites because of the experience I had 8 years ago on this very week.\n\nJust prior to creating the photograph, we delivered pallets of drinking water to many, many families who were affected by the Gold King Mine Spill. The water turned into the same color as the seasonal pumpkin spice of whatever, yet it was toxic, harmful and disgusting.\n\nAs the anniversary of that incredible trip comes around again, I\u2019m reminded of the subtle and minute changes that aren\u2019t seen, the little things.\n\nThe result of helping many families with life\u2019s most precious resource, clean drinking water, a few donated a sizable amount. I still have their names, organizations or companies in mind. What was even more substantial were the 5, 10 and 20 bucks that came our way. All received one of my photographs.\n\nI wanted to show how massive of a difference and improvement can be made when we collectively come together. My goal was to visit a local big box store and buy a pallet or two of drinking water for some grandma\u2019s and families. Instead, I had to figure out how to distribute 7 semi trailers full of drinking water, an awesome problem to have!\n\nAs much as a storm brings havoc to traffic and roads, I absolutely pray for moisture on a regular basis. They too bring much needed life saving elements for us. I\u2019m not sure why I prefer freezing cold weather, to me it is a thrill!\n\nNonetheless, I appreciate the teaching of how much, even a sliver of light, can illuminate a scene. This weekend I was reminded of my favorite set of words about a little bit of light in Alma 36 which states:\n\n\u201c20 And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!\n\n21 Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.\u201d\n\nWe are each other\u2019s medicine. A little idea, a little light, a little more love can go a long way.\n\nPhotos 3-5 by my friend @braydonbphotography", "total_engagement": 1914, "engagement_rate": 0.054391997499218504, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-10-02T18:15:03.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132344640873, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-06T16:37:41.576Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-06T16:37:41.576Z"}, {"id": 607775132344640871, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "756515009", "created_at": "2023-10-06T16:37:41.570Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-06T16:37:41.570Z"}, {"id": 607775132374872955, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-17T08:09:51.599Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-02T06:49:12.099Z"}, {"id": 607775132374872957, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-10-17T08:09:51.606Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-02T06:49:12.105Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175292913189, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cx-kQlrrWjx/", "post_id": "3206159454381631729", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/7157729c6bdc90655d4ed3351500b03a.JPEG", "phash": "95a526256b727b32", "image_entities": [{"entity": "dune", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6375015377998352}, {"entity": "black-and-white", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5215859413146973}, {"entity": "black", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.473783016204834}, {"entity": "monochrome photography", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.39532673358917236}, {"entity": "monochrome", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3765600621700287}, {"entity": "nature", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.373393177986145}, {"entity": "ocean", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3525424599647522}, {"entity": "outdoors", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3216613829135895}, {"entity": "sand", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2857571244239807}, {"entity": "sea", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.27962198853492737}, {"entity": "sky", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.27366146445274353}, {"entity": "water", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2636367976665497}, {"entity": "rug", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8803024291992188}, {"entity": "sweater", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4816557466983795}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3544289469718933}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-10-06T02:17:15.609Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-28T06:27:55.220Z"}}], "post_text": "\u2014 The One\n\nAcross my readings, audio books and podcasts, I\u2019m intrigued by how much of a difference those who are accomplishing a bit, all seem to carry the same denominator of making a single change at some point.\n\nI\u2019m excited to add a refrigerator to my Rivian R1T because it\u2019ll force me to cut some plastic which once done, there is no going back. The result may force me to fill it with carrots, celery, sugar snap peas for Bubblegum and other better choices of snacks than chips or gummy nerds.\n\nThis morning I woke up at 5:30am and turned on our gas fireplace because our furnace isn\u2019t functioning as it should. At the flip of two switches, our living room is warming up.\n\nDoing so I felt like I was cheating and thought of my dear mother who never took any shortcuts.\n\nAs life casted its lots on her, she persevered and sacrificed so much so we could have. Often, the results were little blessings coming from one working multiple jobs, going above and beyond, not because she was hoping for an increase in wage, it\u2019s who she was and still is.\n\nWithout expecting much in return, she gave, gave and still gives. My input to have her slow down has been useless. She\u2019s my ultimate example of giving because she still does.\n\nOne of her most profound teachings that will resonate with me into the eternity\u2019s is \u201cif you have one more, you can share\u201d.\n\nAnytime I see two similar features in nature, I am immediately drawn to my older sister. We both were fed, nourished and supported by a single mother. I\u2019m not sure how we ever managed, we did because of the sweet grit of my mother.\n\nThe sweet blessing for me was a mere stranger walking into my life and after many years, he being the only man I will ever call dad.\n\nHe too has made sacrifices to provide and I have an awesome younger sister!\n\nAs I look at these two pebbles in the bottom left corner, I\u2019m reminded of where we\u2019ve come from.\n\nBy the small single decisions we make each day, I hope I end up where I would like to be. One idea, one change and fulfilling one commitment at a time.

Over 20 square miles of hidden gems, no fences and a dozen horses to ride!\n\nWhat a difference.\n\nI recall my father, uncles and his friends helping us build our home. I\u2019ll forever remember the night he peeled back the blue 10\u2019x10\u2019 tarp from the unfinished roof. Dad on one end, mom and my little sister in between and I on the other. I felt special \u201cprotecting\u201d mom and Tweet.\n\nOn 3\u201d foam pads, I didn\u2019t sleep that night because I could hear crickets, coyotes, bugs & every now and then I saw satellites wiz by.\n\nI saw a shooting star and no kid felt luckier than me.\n\nSoon, we were going to have our own home. It took a while to complete the house. I knew when it was payday because we always bought more lumber or building materials.\n\nThat 600 square foot home, though small, immeasurably massive as it was filled with love, challenges and hard work.\n\nMiddle school came. I recall starting my 7th grade year wearing clothes from prior years. Life and work was tough. I was the joke amidst my friends for wearing what I could.\n\nUltimately, I overcame a few days of taunting. Deep within, I was so happy because for the first time, I wouldn\u2019t be sleeping on 3\u201d foam pads.\n\nWe got bunk beds!\n\nI recall it was a Saturday around 3pm, the beds were fully assembled and all I wanted to do was lay in bed.\n\nAfter high school I lived off PCH a couple minutes from the pier in Huntington Beach, CA.\n\nMy first night in the apartment, the power went out in the city and I slept on the floor.\n\nI couldn\u2019t feel any more comfortable with a flash light in hand surrounded by frantic people without electricity and running water.\n\nMy parents visited our house a few weeks ago and I\u2019ve never seen my mother so happy.\n\nThe little Mylo in me came out and I showed her what we had and that our house is a 24/7 extension of my childhood castle.\n\nEvery now and then I sleep on a 3\u201d foam pad in my roof top tent.

Being able to speak with this grandpa and grandma in our language is a conversation I won\u2019t ever forget. As they are in their 90\u2019s, they are part of a completely different generation. One of simplicity, love, humility, caring for others and absolute kindness being the standard.\n\nA generation where having sufficient was bountiful. A generation where gratitude for drops of rain were equivalent to a viral monsoon storm.\n\nThey\u2019re a generation which may not understand the engineering behind my electric truck with 835 horsepower when a good horse in their time was beyond plenty.\n\nI shed tears of happiness because there aren\u2019t many of the wise ones and in front of me are such precious souls.\n\nI\u2019ve always loved this song which is so much more powerful in our Mother Language.

It wasn\u2019t until high school I realized I had so much to smile for and from a single experience, I stopped caring.\n\nA few months ago our daughter Bubblegum made a joke about my crooked tooth. I shrugged it off because I\u2019m a grown ass man, however, about a half hour later she pulled me aside with sniffles and said she was so sorry for what she said. She didn\u2019t mean to hurt my feelings and that she loved to see me smile \ud83e\udd72\n\nI was so proud of her for apologizing and handling her words in a mature manner for her age. At eight, she continues to amaze me.\n\nI continue to smile from ear to ear every day because I have so much to be happy about. Even when life isn\u2019t allowing us to grow our family with fertility issues, the list goes on with challenges, and so does the ability to smile. There\u2019s always a reason or two even when the light seems to be quite dim.\n\nWhen I was asked to photograph my fellow Thule athletes, I had an idea of what the experience might be like. The thoughts were far from the actual experience and all I did was become sore from smiling so much!\n\nThe riders, the light and the conditions favored us. It\u2019s as if the universe knew we were all at work and she provided!\n\nI\u2019m fortunate to be around amazing athletes and share photographs of them with my Indigenous community in hopes more of us will be behind the camera.\n\nExperiencing places like Iceland, Norway and soon, going quite West and East beyond oceans, I was once shy to smile and the places now see my grin.\n\nTomorrow, we go home to Navajoland. I can\u2019t wait to cross the Male River and give thanks like I saw my paternal grandpa do so many times.\n\nThe Chase to smile isn\u2019t worth the delay for that physical expression. Thank you Micayla, Spencer and Joey for this incredible experience! I hope we meet again someday.\n\n#BringYourLife", "total_engagement": 1142, "engagement_rate": 0.03245332348176987, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-10-20T03:55:58.000Z", "brands":

last post I made was a couple weeks ago. During that time I reflected so much on the purpose of life and my time here on this planet.\n\nIt seems to me time is fleeting and every now and then, I squeeze in as much as I can into a given day.\n\nI feel as though I will never know if I lived the purpose of my life because when the time comes I will be silent and my babies will speak.\n\nI\u2019ve said to my wife countless times that what matters most to me is what Denali and Bubblegum will say about me at my funeral. Many, many years will be forced into a 10-15 minute speech about someone.\n\nIt is then I hope they say I have fulfilled my role as friend to the friendless, father to them and husband to my Lauren. (Hopefully, we\u2019ll have fostered and/or adopted others too.)\n\nI\u2019m writing this while in Amsterdam and just called my mother. She was so happy and proud of me.\n\nWhen I was in 2nd grade she bought a 50\u00a2 map of America that showed all the States. She would quiz me on naming the states and their capital\u2019s. The next year she bought a world map. I recall it being the same size as a kids menu from Denny\u2019s, like a placemat size.\n\nI then began to memorize the countries and continents of the world.\n\nWhile on the phone with my mom, she said \u201cyou remember we used to talk about the world when you were small? Now you\u2019re out there\u2026\u201d\n\nThe little Mylo in me could only think of one thing and that is to show my sweet mother the world.\n\nWhat a contrast from barely affording a 50\u00a2 map. I feel I\u2019m her only chance to do such a thing.\n\nAs we prepare to wind down this year and fixate our goals for the next, creating meaningful memories with my family is still the top priority.\n\nOne day, I will cover my mom\u2019s eyes as she did mine so I wouldn\u2019t peak at the map, and show her places like Paris, Switzerland, Hawai\u2019i, Sweden and others.\n\nI was recently asked about my Instagram. My response was simple in that it\u2019s an archive I hope my kids read through at some future time.

Most of that curious comes from many nights sleeping outside in my youth. Whether that was sleeping in a tree house, truck bed or in a tent, I lost track of time counting satellites, shooting stars and seeing odd things move around above.\n\nI\u2019ll also never forget the time we tricked my mom to turn on the lights in our house. She wasn\u2019t aware that the electricity was actually working in our house.\n\nShe being a fun sport, flipped the switch expecting nothing, the lights turned on and she froze. In awe and amazement, she said \u201cthis weekend we\u2019re going to buy a microwave!\u201d It was funny and our lives changed a lot from that day.\n\nWe stopped buying single use batteries, propane tanks and replaced our two lightbulbs with LED\u2019s. This all happened about 20 years ago and I believe those lightbulbs are still lighting up my parents home!\n\nAs much as life has improved for our family, many are still left without and we\u2019re progressing to minimize the canyon of being online with power.\n\nMy incredible friends at @goalzero is giving our non-profit partner @heartofamerica a Yeti 1000 for every purchase of a Yeti 1000 today! This buy one, give one will help you have the power you need and help others on a daily basis too.\n\nI use our Goal Zero yeti batteries to charge my devices, lights, cotton candy maker, grill, cameras and so much more.\n\nLiving with a power source, whether that be grid or solar power, has made a tremendous impact on my life.\n\nTo help or learn more, visit the link in my bio on this #GivingTuesday \u2014 Like a telescope pointing to a star, together, we can bring that light and power much closer to those without.\n\nAs cool as it is being on summits of mountains, nothing is greater than being on a roof empowering the next generation for humanity.", "total_engagement": 611, "engagement_rate": 0.017363380601892638, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-28T17:18:35.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "shooting stars", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lights", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tent", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "youth", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nights", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "track", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "house", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mom", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "many", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nothing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sport", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sky", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "power", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "givingtuesday"}], "mentions": [{"name": "goalzero"}, {"name": "heartofamerica"}], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132496749990, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-06T19:17:21.868Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-06T19:17:21.868Z"}, {"id": 607775132496749989, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "134008334", "created_at": "2023-12-06T19:17:21.864Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-06T19:17:21.864Z"}, {"id": 607775132498557591, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-07T11:29:35.700Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-18T11:02:44.667Z"}, {"id": 607775132498557592, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-12-07T11:29:35.705Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-18T11:02:44.673Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175367745538, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C0zfCR_OJjN/", "post_id": "3257083451714083021", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/17a5c3fe90189cf4eab889f960768179.JPEG", "phash": "c63c7936cce32c19", "image_entities": [{"entity": "flower", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7024566531181335}, {"entity": "orange", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.49036985635757446}, {"entity": "petal", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21566638350486755}, {"entity": "baseball cap", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.49373406171798706}, {"entity": "bird", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2854195535182953}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22910848259925842}, {"entity": "painting", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22137781977653503}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-12-21T02:01:32.908Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-29T18:49:34.433Z"}}], "post_text": "\u2014 Joy\n\nI have a new 500+ mile bike film coming out and hopefully soon, it\u2019ll be viewable. The ride was about a crucial visual regarding the chance to overcome real tough times, making challenging and scary decisions and ultimately, about joy. It\u2019s what lasts.\n\nDuring this time of the year, happiness sneaks its way into our homes through the medium of gifts, thoughts and what lies beneath a thin layer of wrapping paper.\n\nDuring this time of year, the slot canyons back home receive a special kind of light that isn\u2019t found during the other seasons. The slot canyons is where my attention to exposure values began. In addition to that, it\u2019s where my career started by asking a lady if she\u2019d like some help with camera settings.\n\nThe result of making some adjustments on a big-digital-camera (3 megapixels), was her hitting the review button and saying \u201choly shit!\u201d because of what she saw. Not a second later, other photographers asked what settings she was using and she said something I\u2019ll never forget, \u201cAsk Mylo! He\u2019ll set you up!!\u201d\n\nThat simple result was something I was terrified to do. Intimidated by many with lenses and expensive gear, I was timid in asking if someone would like help.\n\nDoing so, changed the absolute trajectory of my life, career and purpose of existence. Again, a very scary decision to commit to figuring out light.\n\nDuring this time of the year, we hang lights on our tree, gutter and deck. As I see the lights change colors, they create a beautiful visual.\n\nOne year my father surprised us by coming home from work in Indonesia. The flight from Phoenix to Page flys overhead, close to my parent\u2019s home.\n\nI recall lighting up our roof on the hogan, without design, hoping my father would see our little home from the airplane. While setting up the lights, a few lights weren\u2019t working and if they didn\u2019t work, the entire display was non functional.\n\nI never forgot that because we all have light. Together, we create something beautiful.\n\nWhen my dad got home, he said he could see the house from a ways above. May we see the Light in each other and help brighten the dim ones of others, not only in this season however every single one to come.\n\nThat is Joy.", "total_engagement": 886, "engagement_rate":

Light\n\nI grew up with the teaching of running and its many benefits including the oneness with our provider, Mother Earth.\n\nFrom running after sheep, horses and partaking in ceremonies like the coming of age or even through our 12 acre fields of food, my favorite was running to our tree houses!\n\nI\u2019m beyond fortunate to have incredible childhood friends. In high school I had an absolute love/hate relationship with running. Hate because of the pain and constant competition of our varsity team and the love of brotherhood, teammates and again, the oneness. No time outs, referee\u2019s or even substitutes, it was an all out effort to perform from the start.\n\nUltimately, I loved cross country because its what helped me graduate! It was the motivation to keep my grades up in order to participate in sports. Together, we won State every year to continue the deep Running Devil roots of the boys from Page.\n\nFast forward a couple decades and running is still deep within us. My good brother, Shaun Martin, led us through tough races and was the example of running to me. He is an incredible example of doing good. In his community, it is rare to go anywhere and not have people thank him or say \u201cHi Mr. Martin!!\u201d The respect he and his wife Melissa have in the heart of Navajoland is beautiful as they empower the next generation of students as Principals of two schools. Both also started the Canyon De Chelly 55k Ultra in 2012. A run that sells out within seconds allowing 150 runners to join.\n\nSince the beginning we\u2019ve been using more @goalzero lights and batteries to power the start/finish line, aid stations and first aide equipment.\n\nThis year I brought two of the new Sky Lights to help with lighting before the sunrise.

It is quieter, less traffic and the silence is incredible! I also face a fear head on! (Camping solo\u2026)\n\nAt night I don\u2019t sleep much because my hearing is 100x better and annoying. In my youth I had to listen to how the dogs are barking, listen for a constant bell noise and all sorts of sounds outside because coyotes and other predators could be attacking our livestock or property.\n\nI have always been a light sleeper! And when I sleep good, I sleep really, really good!! (Last night I probably slept 10 hours between the couch and our bed!)\n\nI feel the Light above always remind me of their impact. The stars we see is light that left on their maiden voyage to shine for us around 4,000 years ago. The lights are 4,000 years old and could be different in real time. This is such a fascinating concept!\n\nI don\u2019t know if my life will make an impact 4,000 years from now like the stars and to a very large degree, my focus is on the current and next couple of generations.\n\nMost of all, the impact I want to make is for my family, especially for Denali and Bubblegum. I hope they see me try to do hard things. At times I cry in front of them because I miss my Elders and laugh like crazy when we do something so funny!\n\nWhen both kids were born I took a walk outside at night. I vividly remember both nights. The shooting star, snowfall, trees and so much more.\n\nI was impacted by their birth and joining us in this world coming from the previous. My Elders taught me so much and the phenomenal peace they always provided was our reunion after this short time on Mother Earth.\n\nThe photos are stars in the Uintas, Iceland, Navajoland, Alaska and Utah. Regardless of where I see them, I\u2019m always moved. Their impact on my compass helps guide the way for the next generation.\n\nOn a cold, star filled night back home on Navajoland 11 years ago, Denali was born.

Back then, it was almost a guarantee that sledding would happen on Christmas Day. The family get together was like Home Alone multiplied by many. Our dear sweet aunt Rose would coordinate the program, songs and it was so much fun.\n\nMy aunt Rose created the foundation of our family\u2019s Christmas tradition. It was always exciting because my other aunts and uncles would come and bring all their kids. It was a riot to play, play and play!\n\nMy aunt Rose was so excited about life and her energy was contagious. I remember her being the first example of fund raising and working real hard to achieve the goal. One year she showed me what she was going to do and I was her first donor. My hard earned $2 made her smile.\n\nEvery year when Christmas lights, trees, songs and the Spirit of it all begins, I immediately think of my aunt Rose.\n\nShe has been in the world of Great Spirits for a while now. We miss her and I wished Bubblegum would have met her. They are so alike and full of fun, care and kindness.\n\nMy favorite Christmas song since my youth has been Silent Night. To me, it has a different meaning.\n\nFor many, their nights are still silent from those who\u2019ve continued their Holy Journey.

When Denali was 3-4 months old, we set out on a 10 day trip. I packed so much and still remember a few details. We redid that same trip when he was able to stand on his own.\n\nAnother trip I recall, which I recently got more details on, was when we stopped by a windmill in the middle of nowhere. I was around 1st grade and my father had won the bull riding event. He won a few hundred tough bucks and we washed at the windmill to prep for a ceremony. Photos of those are in my mother\u2019s album.\n\nI also recall the very first time we packed everything we needed about 35 years ago, we took so many backroads in our 84 Chevy with a camper. I spent the entire time in the back since I had the freedom to bounce around and not be confined to a seat.\n\nOccasionally, we\u2019d stop and I\u2019d emerge from a man cub made tornado! I\u2019ll forever remember, dang near Lion King style, my father drove to a summit. I recall feeling like a marble in a sardine can through the \u201cHANG ON\u201d shouts!\n\nDad took me to a point and we looked across a beautiful valley. I\u2019d later realize it was Heber, UT. Without much pavement in our route, it was pure overlanding without today\u2019s version of the genre. In my youth I fell in love with the valley. Living there for a moment was a no brainer and I can be in that valley within 45 minutes!\n\nWe had everything we needed back then for the weeklong trip. \n\nWhile I spot wildlife in the harsh winter of the Rockies, I am amazed at all they have, which isn\u2019t much. Most of all, I fall deeper in thought of the (ancient) ones well before us and how they survived in balance with our relatives of the wild.\n\nThis Bald Eagle was quite comfortable while I shook in -22\u00b0 weather! Thank goodness for downed jackets, insulated boots, fast shutter speeds and quite a few pixels to have the flakes of snow in detail!\n\nSoon, my @sonyalpha gear will shake things up in some real cold weather.

Broke with a dream, it was the first time I dedicated myself to something and created a specific savings account.\u2028\u2028The feeling of exploring, hiking and waiting around for whatever light was all I wanted to do. My friends and I saw a lot of the Southwest. Some moved on and I stayed in our little 4 stop light town. I got paid to play in the dirt and be surrounded by the Eden for landscape photography.\n\nA high profile client came to town with a beautiful family. They wanted portraits and oddly, I got the invite. Understanding what they wanted, I recall telling them two things.\n\nOne, they needed someone with a digital camera, not me with a 4x5 view camera. The other was a photographer from Vegas or LA. I was up front and told them I couldn\u2019t fit the bill because I was proficient in photographing rocks, trees, dirt and water, not people.\n\u2028The gentleman from the Middle East then said calmly with confidence \u201cYou may be right about these however, everything is possible. Most of all, you and your people are from here. This is your land. Someone else won\u2019t know the terrain and light. Where can you get a digital camera?\u201d\n\nI said \u201cthe nearest one is probably in Phoenix.\u201d He then said something I\u2019ll never forget.\u2028\u2028\u201cWell, it sounds like we\u2019ll see you tomorrow morning. Put the camera on my bill too.\u201d\u2028\u2028I said ok and I hauled butt to Phoenix full of energy and stoke!\n\nFortunately the same place I bought my first camera (large format view camera) was restocking late into the night.\u2028\u2028I know I could have indulged in the latest however I made a modest choice; a Nikon D700 with the kit lens. It worked to create their photographs and the family was happy!\n\nBy early February nearly 80% of the New Years resolutions made, will have met the end of their journey.\n\nThe first two images are from my first wildlife trip with that D700, a 2-3 minute encounter with a stunning fox from the early 2000\u2019s. The last two images are from a recent fox with the latest and greatest from Sony.\n\nKeep the Pinky Promises and Keep Dreaming. They may get you somewhere meaningful.

thoughts about the size of our known universe.

The odds of being here are so much to one, yet, I sometimes forget that alone is worth the gratitude I should feel each fleeting moment of the passing sun.\n\nAnother revolution around a fireball was made and all I can say about this upcoming year is it will be filled with so much pressure, performance and passion.\n\nUnfortunately, many misuse the word passion using it in a positive, living my dream, kinda way when it is the absolute opposite filled with suffering, fear, aloneness, doubt, do I matter?, is this worth it?\u2026 not quite the word to use synonymously with \u201cliving life to the fullest\u2026\u201d\n\nMy father once said \u201cevery now and then you have to have holy shit moments!\u201d That\u2019s when you know you are entering a realm of greater self discovery, internal expansion and growth.\n\nMay you all have a year you want and may it be filled with more holy shit moments as you grow, explore (not just in nature or on a trail) and above all, learn more about those who have opposite beliefs than you. Doing so will only test the veracity of your foundation while building a greater level of empathy for those who believe differently than you.
