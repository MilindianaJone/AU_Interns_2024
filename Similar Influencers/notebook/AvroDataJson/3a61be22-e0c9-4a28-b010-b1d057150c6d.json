In 2020 my sister and I were estranged from our mother because we had stopped hearing from our her back in 2018. Any time we were around her she acted like we were a burden or that we were too overwhelming for her. Since my sister and I both struggle with cptsd and ADHD, those pesky feelings of abandonment are all too familiar, so we backed off and figured if she missed us she would reach out. Three years went by\u2026. So when the pandemic hit in 2020 and the world was turned upside down, we were shocked when we received a call from family that our mother was being evicted and that we had to pack her up and figure out a plan for her. We were thrown out into outer space. The moment I saw my mother after years of estrangement I knew something was terribly wrong. It was mind blowing to see the decline that she had taken since we had seen her last. In 2021 I took her for a doctors appointment because her mind was slipping and I needed validation so that we could begin a journey towards getting her back on her feet. Little did we know, she would never have that opportunity. It took 3 years of brain scans, doctors appointments, endless gaslighting, and shrugged shoulders before we were taken seriously. In May of 2023 I took her for a psychological evaluation and in July of 2023 we received a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. Finally someone saw what we had been seeing all along, finally someone was willing to actively listen to us and to our mother, finally we had answers. By the end of August my sister and I had to make the difficult decision to place her in an assisted living/nursing home. First off let me say that that was the HARDEST decisions of my entire 37 years. \n\n*continued in comments, IG posted everything out of order*", "total_engagement": 464, "engagement_rate": 0.044926413632842756, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-20T23:01:56.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "sister", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mom", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "heart", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rollercoaster", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mother", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "feelings", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132484516422, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-30T16:29:36.723Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-30T16:29:36.723Z"}, {"id": 607775132484516421, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-915151204", "created_at": "2023-11-30T16:29:36.719Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-30T16:29:36.719Z"}, {"id": 607775132485021619, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-01T08:46:32.269Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-13T08:03:05.170Z"}, {"id": 607775132485021622, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-12-01T08:46:32.326Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-13T08:03:05.175Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175351164375, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C0FKA21R4dc/", "post_id": "3244043145931360092", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/b1093fff031ed02025466c5ec26729c7.JPEG", "phash": "ef39a0959628b9ac", "image_entities": [{"entity": "blossom", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9888562560081482}, {"entity": "flower", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.947986364364624}, {"entity": "floribunda", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8969006538391113}, {"entity": "flowering plant", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7427431344985962}, {"entity": "julia child rose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.703609049320221}, {"entity": "geranium", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5543304681777954}, {"entity": "leaf", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5088626742362976}, {"entity": "petal", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.45838525891304016}, {"entity": "rose family", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.43758541345596313}, {"entity": "plant", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.38741281628608704}, {"entity": "flower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9010947346687317}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5839197635650635}, {"entity": "chandelier", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4833748936653137}, {"entity": "rose", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2897443175315857}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-11-29T00:04:41.685Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-07T09:42:18.092Z"}}], "post_text": "Reflecting back on the whirlwind that has been 2023, I find myself ruminating on one particular month, a month that tried its hardest to break me. I\u2019d like to tell you about that month to perhaps seek some insight from the internet. \nThe month of March threw me for a loop from the moment it arrived. I decided to ween myself off of my anti depressants (that\u2019s a nightmare) and I had to say goodbye to my sweet familiar, Pisces \ud83d\udc08\u200d\u2b1b .\nEnter March 12th, the day I read the most vile email ever sent to me, but before I go any further, I need to give a bit of backstory first\u2026..\nIn 2021 I found myself struggling with neurodivergent symptoms, cptsd, depression, and anxiety. So I decided to seek therapy. My first therapist wasn\u2019t a good fit so I decided to look for a new one. I had made up my mind that due to the sexual trauma that I have endured throughout different stages of my life that I preferred a female therapist, however things didn\u2019t go exactly to plan. When I went to my scheduled enrollment a 60 year old cis-het white Christian male became my therapist. \ud83e\udd2e Definitely not my first choice but thanks to society making women feel like shit about hurting the poor pathetic feelings of men I decided to give it a go with this person to see if maybe things would be ok. My subconscious was screaming \u201cNO\u201d but I ignored her and went with it.  During our sessions I briefly mentioned my sexual trauma and how I sincerely dislike men because of the trauma. I never really went into detail with him because I knew I couldn\u2019t fully trust him. However I was cordial and did my best to warm up to this male therapist.  His approach was basically talk therapy, I talked and he listened. He didn\u2019t really give advice which was annoying, he just sat there and listened. I saw him from Summer 2021-mid 2022. One day I received a call from the clinic informing me that he was no longer with the company and that I was being assigned to someone else. About a week later I received a message from the male therapist via my email from his private email.\n\n*Continue in comments*", "total_engagement": 405, "engagement_rate": 0.03921378776142525, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-25T19:21:40.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "therapy", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "trauma", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "whirlwind", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "depressants", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "insight", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "therapist", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "email", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nightmare", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hardest", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "loop", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "internet", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132484516426, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-30T16:29:36.844Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-30T16:29:36.844Z"}, {"id": 607775132484516425, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "283197968", "created_at": "2023-11-30T16:29:36.839Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-30T16:29:36.839Z"}, {"id": 607775132485021625, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-01T08:46:32.437Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-13T08:03:05.196Z"}, {"id": 607775132485021626, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-12-01T08:46:32.442Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-13T08:03:05.201Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": null, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/violetdvine", "post_id": "3a61be22-e0c9-4a28-b010-b1d057150c6d", "program_id": null, "location": null, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/BioMatch_placeholder_v2.jpg", "phash": null, "image_entities": null, "phash_property": null}], "post_text": "\ufffc", "total_engagement": null, "engagement_rate": null, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2024-01-13T02:06:12.000Z", "brands": null, "text_entities": null, "hashtags": null, "mentions": null, "categories": null, "post_properties": null}]}
