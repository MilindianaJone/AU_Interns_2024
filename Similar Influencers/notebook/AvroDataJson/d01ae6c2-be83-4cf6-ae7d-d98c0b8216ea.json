Throughout the trial, bizarre claims emerged, including Vallow Daybell's belief that her son and daughter were zombies and that she was a divine being sent to bring about the Biblical apocalypse.\n\nAs the verdict was read, Vallow Daybell remained expressionless, while some individuals in the courtroom gallery wiped away tears.\n\nProsecutors depicted Vallow Daybell as a power-hungry manipulator who was driven to kill her two youngest children for financial gain. However, the defense argued that she was a protective mother who fell under the influence of a cult leader, her fifth husband, Chad Daybell.\n\nDuring the final arguments of the seven-week trial, jurors heard both narratives. They deliberated for approximately four hours before adjourning for the evening, resuming their deliberations the following morning. Shortly after noon, they reached a verdict, which was announced to the courtroom.\n\nVallow Daybell was convicted on charges of conspiring to commit the murders of her 7-year-old son Joshua \"JJ\" Vallow, 16-year-old daughter Tylee Ryan, and Tammy Daybell. She was also found guilty of grand theft and first-degree murder of the two children, indicating her direct involvement in the crimes.\n\nChad Daybell, Vallow Daybell's fifth husband, faces the same charges, but his trial is scheduled for several months later.\n\nThroughout the trial, the testimonies presented were both heartbreaking and strange. Colby Ryan, Vallow Daybell's sole surviving child, accused her of murdering his siblings in a recorded jailhouse phone call. Another witness, Melanie Gibb, testified that Vallow Daybell believed certain people in her life had been possessed by evil spirits and turned into \"zombies,\" including JJ and Tylee.

The indictment, which was unsealed in federal court in Little Rock, accuses Scott, 36, of arranging the transactions with a Pennsylvania man she met through a Facebook group focused on \"oddities.\" Scott, who worked at Arkansas Central Mortuary Services, faces 12 counts, including conspiracy to commit mail fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property, and interstate transportation of stolen property.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Scott approached the buyer, identified in separate state charges as Jeremy Lee Pauley from Pennsylvania, in October 2021. Over a period of nine months, she allegedly sold him various body parts, including fetuses, brains, hearts, lungs, genitalia, and large pieces of skin, among others. The transactions were facilitated through 16 separate PayPal transfers, totaling $10,975. The indictment cites messages sent by Scott to Pauley, including one inquiring about selling a fully intact, embalmed brain.\n\nScott is currently in jail, and a hearing to determine if she will be released on bail is scheduled for Tuesday. The buyer, Jeremy Lee Pauley, faces charges in Pennsylvania related to the case. Pennsylvania officials became aware of the scheme after receiving complaints about Pauley. He is charged with abuse of a corpse, receiving stolen property, and dealing in proceeds of unlawful activities.\n\nProsecutors argue that Scott should remain in custody until trial, emphasizing the gravity of the allegations. The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences expressed gratitude for the federal charges, highlighting the importance of body donations for medical education and considering those who donate their bodies as \"true heroes.\"", "total_engagement": 171, "engagement_rate": 0.01115532650531672, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-15T02:08:42.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "jeremy lee pauley", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "pennsylvania", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "court", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "medical school cadavers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mortuary worker", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "arkansas", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "scott", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "candace chapman", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132078200061, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T15:01:59.986Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T15:01:59.986Z"}, {"id": 607775132078200059, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1300522200", "created_at": "2023-08-04T15:01:59.973Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T15:01:59.973Z"}, {"id": 607775132210927416, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T06:32:18.027Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-04T11:54:33.953Z"}, {"id": 607775132210927418, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-08-23T06:32:18.039Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-04T11:54:33.959Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175213048656, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CsT1Y9JJ2qR/", "post_id": "3104059379572763281", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://instagram.fhan5-8.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/347403730_666549448641416_8743312222664571542_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fhan5-8.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=Ibr1_PoOsfQAX-IQqKh&edm=AKEQFekBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDjn-FzQ7hDa-R64THpu4Mcq1zMhsiJpD_fSNeY03Jhjg&oe=64813774&_nc_sid=1349e3", "phash": null, "image_entities": null, "phash_property": null}], "post_text": "The American \u201cjustice\u201d system is a rat\u2019s nest of fuckery, exploitation, and abuse\u2014and @joe_exotic, viral phenomenon and internationally renowned raconteur, is speaking on it from the inside. \n\nOnce focused on self promotion, the Joe Exotic of 2023 has been campaigning heavily for prison reform over the last 24 months\u2026something HF will always get behind.

This debate became so intense that it sparked a fierce 60-hour editing war on Wikipedia, leading to the page being locked down. Surprisingly, the creator of Garfield, Jim Davis, initially sparked the discussion two years prior in an interview titled \"20 Things You Might Not Know About Garfield,\" where he described the character as being universally undefined in terms of gender, race, nationality, age, or any specific attributes.\n\nInitially, Davis's remarks did not cause any controversy. However, when satirist Virgil Texas stumbled upon the article, he modified Garfield's gender on the wiki page from \"male\" to \"none.\" The internet erupted in response. \n\nWithin an hour, a Wiki editor changed it back to \"male,\" igniting a back-and-forth battle between \"male\" and \"none\" for a grueling 3 days days. At one point, the debate extended to Garfield's religion, with his affiliation being altered to Shiite Muslim (lol). Editors presented \"evidence\" from past comic strips to support their arguments.\n\nAfter the Wiki page was eventually closed and the controversy devolved into contentious opinion pieces, Garfield's creator, Jim Davis, stepped forward to settle the matter. He confirmed to The Washington Post that Garfield is indeed male and explained that he has a girlfriend named Arlene. This declaration prompted Texas to concede defeat, acknowledging Davis as the ultimate authority on Garfield's identity.\n\nThe semantic issue that SEEMS to be at the root of the dispute, is that Davis never suggested that Garfield was not biologically male, as gender specifically refers to social and cultural expressions of identity, which the fat cat appears to be removed from. \n\nBiological sex \u2260 Gender. Gender \u2260 Biological sex. \n\nAnd that's ok \ud83d\ude02.

Spearheaded by Canadian entrepreneur Michael Henderson, the ambitious plan involves erecting a 274-meter (900-foot) sphere atop a 30-meter (100-foot) edifice in the United Arab Emirates city-state.\n\nDubai, already renowned for housing architectural marvels like the world's tallest building, aims to offer visitors an extraordinary encounter resembling a journey to the moon, all while remaining firmly planted on Earth. The project, aptly named MOON, anticipates attracting an annual influx of over 2.5 million guests, potentially generating an astonishing \u00a31.5 billion in revenue each year.\n\nMoon World Resorts Inc, co-founded by Henderson, is financing the venture, estimated to cost around \u00a34.28 billion. Henderson exclaims, \"Eight billion people know our brand, and we haven't even started yet.\"\n\nThe grand scheme encompasses a resort nestled within the spherical structure, featuring an expansive 4,000-room hotel, a 10,000-capacity arena, a vibrant nightclub, and a wellness center. To offer a truly immersive lunar experience, a 'lunar colony' will enable guests to step foot on the moon's simulated surface, providing a tangible sensation of moonwalking.\n\nThe moon replica will be perched atop a pedestal-like building and will radiate a luminous glow at night, imitating a full, half, or crescent moon.\n\nHenderson envisions this endeavor as \"the largest and most successful modern-day tourism project in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region,\" propelling Dubai's annual tourism visitations to new heights, owing to its global allure, brand recognition, and an array of unique integrated attractions.\n\nHenderson's project surpasses the MSG Sphere, a $2.3 billion LED-screened dome slated to open in Las Vegas this year.

However, the doctor responsible for the decision has been terminated from their position.\n\nNorbert Pfeiffer, the hospital's CEO, acknowledged that the surgeon made an erroneous judgment by proceeding with the routine procedure despite the absence of a qualified assistant.

The ring, which had been given to Strand by her husband, Dave, as a 33rd wedding anniversary present, was discovered amidst the refuse of the plant, 13 years after it had slipped off her finger and into the toilet at their home.\n\nStrand vividly recalled the moment of loss, when the ring swirled and disappeared down the drain. She thought to herself, \"He'll never buy me another ring... I felt really bad because it was a gift.\"\n\nThen, on that fateful day, employees at the Rogers, Minnesota plant, including John Tierney, a mechanical maintenance manager, spotted a glimmer of light amidst the debris.\n\nRecognizing the ring's unique design, Tierney believed that attempting to reunite it with its owner might not be an impossible task. So the Metropolitan Council turned to social media, raising the flag on their discovery, likening it to finding a needle in a haystack.\n\nIn a tweet accompanied by an image of a ring amidst hay, they wrote, \"Recently, we found a ring at one of our regional wastewater treatment plants. This is a rare occurrence, and we want to return the ring to its owner! Please contact us if you lost a wedding ring down the drain.\"\n\nThe post sparked an influx of calls to the plant, with people hopeful that their lost ring might be the one. Responding to the requests, individuals were asked to submit photos of the ring for identification. Ultimately, two local jewelers scrutinized the pictures and identified one that seemed to be a match. It turned out to be Mary Strand's ring.\n\nThe ring, though worn and weathered from its unexpected journey through the plant, was finally back in Strand's possession. Remarkably, the water treatment plant where it was found is situated on a road named Diamond Lake. Strand intends to have the ring reset and ready to wear once again, just in time for her 46th wedding anniversary with her husband.", "total_engagement": 144, "engagement_rate": 0.009393959162371974, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-23T23:40:41.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "metropolitan council", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "john tierney", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ring", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "waste", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "dave", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "minnesota", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "plant", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "water treatment plant", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "employees", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132078200145, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T15:02:00.778Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T15:02:00.778Z"}, {"id": 607775132078200143, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "2106273450", "created_at": "2023-08-04T15:02:00.776Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T15:02:00.776Z"}, {"id": 607775132210927460, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T06:32:18.273Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-04T11:54:34.105Z"}, {"id": 607775132210927461, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-08-23T06:32:18.288Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-04T11:54:34.109Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175213048641, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Csz_eqFuxyh/", "post_id": "3113110951150951585", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://instagram.frix1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/349438158_1280565162548920_2109245090791010770_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=instagram.frix1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=9kxKJ-vpNX0AX-3C3nH&edm=AKEQFekBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDy1u2AhvPKIoaGUbKY6SSbMTtDpdyqft1anBNrWRbh_A&oe=64ABCB8A&_nc_sid=29ddf3", "phash": null, "image_entities": null, "phash_property": null}], "post_text": "In these grating times it\u2019s nice to see people fighting for what matters. \ud83e\uddc0 \n\n2023\u2019s new King of Petty, 62-year-old Arnold Wachtel, is suing 123-year-old New York foodstuffers Ottomanelli Bros.

owner named Miles Walker thought he, and his coins, were slick. But they ain\u2019t. Walker has been ordered to pay $39,934 in back wages and damages to nine employees, including former employee Andreas Flaten, by federal labor officials. \n\nThe mess began when Flaten complained about not receiving his final paycheck of $915. In retaliation, Walker dumped 91,500 pennies, all coated in oil, in Flaten's driveway + a pay stub containing an offensive message. The U.S. Department of Labor filed a lawsuit against Walker and his company, A OK Walker Autoworks, accusing them of retaliation & failure to properly compensate employees for overtime work.\n\nThe lawsuit concluded with a federal judge's consent judgment on June 13. According to the judgment, Flaten will receive $8,690 in back wages\u2026and damages for the greasy insult from his former boss. The investigation by the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division revealed that Flaten and eight other workers were also not adequately paid for their overtime hours. Regional Administrator Juan Coria emphasized workers should ALWAYS receive their wages without harassment or intimidation.\n\nIn addition to the monetary penalties, the court order requires Walker and his company to adhere to federal minimum wage and overtime regulations. They are also prohibited from making any references to Flaten on the company's website. However, the website of A OK Walker Autoworks still indirectly mentions the \"pennies issue\" in a post on its testimonials page, suggesting that most reviews between March and July 2021 may be fabricated.", "total_engagement": 142, "engagement_rate": 0.009263487507339031, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-06-21T01:05:04.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "labor officials", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "workers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "georgia", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "auto shop owner", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mess", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "retaliation & failure", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "andreas flaten", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "miles walker", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "employees", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132078200299, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T15:02:02.063Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T15:02:02.063Z"}, {"id": 607775132078200298, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1624471502", "created_at": "2023-08-04T15:02:02.060Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T15:02:02.060Z"}, {"id": 607775132210927522, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T06:32:18.558Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-04T11:54:34.288Z"}, {"id": 607775132210927524, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T06:32:18.565Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-04T11:54:34.291Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175223733024, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Ct2xTI0LE2V/", "post_id": "3131907410297114005", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/a9983fd3c8fbff9e3cec9f06e810b11f.JPEG", "phash": "b0f44f2bb3cb4d80", "image_entities": [{"entity": "judo", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4023340940475464}, {"entity": "martial arts", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.31071311235427856}, {"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30156564712524414}, {"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8564373850822449}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6031896471977234}, {"entity": "bicycle helmet", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24314847588539124}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-07-16T10:48:16.698Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-22T05:33:30.191Z"}}], "post_text": "You may have had a bad week, but you didn\u2019t die twice. \n\nThe nightmare scenario went down in Ecuador earlier this month when 76-year-old Bella Montoya, a retired nurse, fell unresponsive after a serious stroke in her nursing home.

through the streets alongside joggers and parents with strollers.\n\nAkane and Satsuki, the two alpacas, are led by their keepers on a leisurely walk, passing by shops, temples, and even pausing to graze on the grass in a small park. They gracefully share the crosswalks with occasional pedestrians before returning to their home at \"Alpaca Land,\" an indoor petting zoo.\n\nAfter some gentle brushing and grooming, these woolly South American natives are ready for their day, where they get to spend time with visitors eager to interact with them. For a fee of 1,000 yen ($7), guests can enjoy 30 minutes of petting, hugging, and nuzzling their faces into the alpacas' irresistibly soft fleece.\n\nOne delighted visitor, Nana Ide, gushed about her experience, sharing how the alpaca's fluffiness covered half of her face when she leaned against its back, creating an incredibly adorable moment.\n\nShinya Ide, the manager of Alpaca Land (no relation to Nana), believes the key to the alpacas' charm lies in the comfort they bring to people. The simple act of observing them is comforting, but petting them takes it to another level, offering a soothing effect to those who interact with them.\n\nAccording to Shinya, alpacas are naturally skittish and timid creatures. When approached by unfamiliar people, they may spit or run away, making them challenging to interact with for some. However, Akane and Satsuki are exceptional exceptions. Over their five years at Alpaca Land, they have been trained and have naturally acquired laid-back personalities, making them accustomed to human interaction and enjoyable companions for visitors.", "total_engagement": 170, "engagement_rate": 0.011090090677800249, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-08-03T17:10:48.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "streets", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "visitors", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "satsuki", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "parents", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "joggers", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tokyo", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "alpaca land", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "nana ide", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "natives", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "neighborhood", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "pair", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sight", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "guests", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132084513339, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-07T04:35:37.321Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-07T04:35:37.321Z"}, {"id": 607775132084513338, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-161439965", "created_at": "2023-08-07T04:35:37.318Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-07T04:35:37.318Z"}, {"id": 607775132210927576, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T06:32:18.685Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-26T12:24:31.208Z"}, {"id": 607775132210927579, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T06:32:18.692Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-26T12:24:31.218Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175238615785, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CvqHqbPpy_s/", "post_id": "3164375389978439660", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/812fb68ca56437d46faf085af02471db.JPEG", "phash": "d0c14d1d931f6f86", "image_entities": [{"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3393305540084839}, {"entity": "sky", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2807239592075348}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21752305328845978}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8584216833114624}, {"entity": "soccer ball", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5701801776885986}, {"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4753172993659973}, {"entity": "football", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.44897156953811646}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.302125483751297}, {"entity": "sweater", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24947866797447205}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-08-23T01:42:49.329Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-22T05:35:45.981Z"}}], "post_text": "In a tragic and disturbing incident, a well-known YouTube chef named Daniel Sancho Bronchalo has recently faced charges in court for the alleged brutal murder of his boyfriend, Dr. Edwin Arrieta Arteaga, a 44-year-old Colombian plastic surgeon. The incident occurred during their vacation on the beautiful Thai island of Koh Pha Ngan, known for its scenic beaches and vibrant \"full moon\" parties.\n\nLocal authorities revealed that an argument between the couple, related to \"sex and money,\" escalated into a deadly confrontation. The police suspect that the crime may have been premeditated, as there were indications of dubious activities by the suspect before the incident. Daniel Sancho Bronchalo reportedly knew the victim even before they arrived in Thailand.\n\nAfter attending a full moon party with friends, Mr. Sancho reported his lover missing, but suspicions arose when body parts, including hips and thighs, were discovered by locals at a landfill site on the island. Shockingly, it has been alleged that the accused dismembered Dr. Arteaga's body into 14 pieces and disposed of some in a rubbish dump while using a kayak to discard others at sea in a suitcase, including the victim's head.\n\nFollowing investigations and DNA tests confirming the identity of the remains, Mr. Sancho was charged with premeditated murder and concealing a corpse to hide the death or cause of death. Reports from other media outlets suggested that the YouTuber had purchased knives, plastic bags, and cleaning supplies from convenience stores on the island.\n\nThe accused's family issued a statement seeking respect and understanding during this distressing period of uncertainty.

They're slapping a $50 \"Parenting Skills Check\" on families whose kids bring chaos to the table.\n\nTim Richter, the mastermind behind this culinary nut check, claims it all started during the pandemic, posting an \"Adult surcharge: For adults unable to parent $$$\" warning on the menu, like a gastronomic game show.\ud83c\udf89\n\nAs predicted, drama unfolded recently when a group of 11 kids aged 3 to 8 dined in, who Richter said were \u201crunning all over the restaurant.\u201d\n\nLyndsey Landmann thought Richter was joking when he told her of the charge. Landmann, from Florida, was at the restaurant with her husband and four other families. \u201cThe kids were sitting at one end of the table, and they were being so good,\u201d Landmann said. \u201cI even commented halfway through the meal, \u2018I can\u2019t believe how well-behaved they are.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen some adults took the kids to the river post-dessert, Richter threatened the $50 charge because the kids were being \"too loud.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, Landmann's husband jumped into the restaurant review ring, throwing a one-star punch on Google.
