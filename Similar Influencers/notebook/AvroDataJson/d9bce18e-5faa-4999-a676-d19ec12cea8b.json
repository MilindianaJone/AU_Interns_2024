Think you wouldnt have the option to make more? 70% of hiring managers say they expect candidates to negotiate, but they won't tell them. This means if you don't advocate for yourself, you're more likely than not going to be making less for the same role than someone who does. This $500k difference also doesn't include the free money you could have made by learning how to invest that extra cash. The \"nice girl\" narrative is one forced upon women from the time their born, telling them to be small, not take up too much space, to be quiet, and agreeable. And this narrative is keeping women underpaid, and widening the wealth gap. One of the first things we teach our students is how to negotiate, so they can make more money for every hour of their life they're already trading for money. Then we teach them how to pull that money into the right places to have it grow and work FOR them. Confidence comes from knowledge, it comes from experience, and it comes from believing that you ARE WORTHY. Don't let those limiting beliefs stop you from getting what you deserve. You are not bad for wanting more money. You are not bad for asking for your worth. Ready to learn?

Here's how you can use it to get rich \ud83d\udcb8 Because did you realize the most millionaires are made during times like these? First thing we need to know is corrections, those are normal. They happen once every two years. We shouldn't be surprised when they occur, we should begin to expect it, and use them to our advantage. Second thing is that most people get scared when the market crashes, and they make emotional decisions (like selling their stocks) which is actually what causes them to lose money. Because the stock market as a whole has recovered from crashes 100% of the time. (this is why we don't buy individual stocks, and we diversify + hold long term) Right now we're in and out of a bear market, and that means the market is down 20% or more from recent highs. On average, it takes about 19 months for stocks to recover their losses. But for the last three bear (or near bear) markets in 2011, 2018 and 2020, it took stocks just four to five months to make up the losses. Third thing is that the stock markets best days, where you make the most money, generally happen around the worst days. So how do you use this to your advantage? Do what the millionaires are doing. I'm dollar cost averaging my money into the stock market to take advantage of this sale. According to the Wells Fargo Investment Institute study, the average 12-month return after the end of a bear market is 43.4% You could make 43% on your money in a single year. This is not the time to be scared, it's the time to learn and take action. Instead of buying when stocks are already high, buy when they're low and ride them up - what's where you make the most money. Ready to learn?

That it's too hard for the average person. That you need to be good at math. That you need to have a lot of money to start. That it's not something regular people should do. But that couldn't be further from the truth. Investing isn't for the rich, it's how you get rich... and it's not only how you get rich, it's the only real way to build financial safety and security for yourself long term. The average American is said to make $1.6M in their lifetime, but need $1.7M to retire. Even if you saved every dollar you ever made it wouldn't be enough. Everyday people have amassed large amounts of wealth, set themselves up for their dream life, and created generational wealth simply by clicking a few buttons (once they knew which buttons to click). The process is actually very simple, and it's one I used to become a millionaire at 30. It's also the one I've taught to thousands of students who have gone on to do incredible things like: \ud83d\udcb8 maxing out their retirement accounts \ud83d\udcb8 locking in their millionaire status in their 20s and 30s \ud83d\udcb8 setting themselves up to retire early or even work part time In all cases, they learned how to make more money without working harder (that's the dream, right?!).

more. \n\nIn the article the author discusses how she feels like she missed the class on how to manage money, but it seems she just woke up one day and her male peers knew how to apply for mortgages and invest in their IRAs, but she was still googling what APR meant. \n\nIs it that men just intrinsically know these things? \n\nNo, no one is born knowing anything - everything, every skill, is taught and learned. \n\nStudies have shown time and time again that there is a difference between the ways we as a society treat women and men when it comes to money, and this extends even into our families. \n\nHow many men have grown up hearing they just need to find a woman with a good job to marry and take care of him? \n\nConversely how many women are told the same? \n\nIt doesn't stop there. \n\n\"A study analyzed the difference between how male and female-centric media outlets speak to their readers about money, and the results show some inherent \u2014 and problematic \u2014 differences. The study looked at 300 stories, and researchers found that women were defined as \"excessive spenders\" across 65% of the articles aimed at them. They were advised to \u201climit, restrict, and take better control of shopping 'splurges'.\u201d In contrast, Starling Bank says, the language of the men\u2019s articles implied that financial successes made readers \u201cmore of a man\". The articles used words like \"dare\" to encourage men to \u201cinvest\u201d and to \"spend\" to achieve \u201cpower\u201d. Back over on the women's side though, 71% of articles encouraged women to seek out \"vouchers\", \"discounts\", \"bargains and coupons\" to save money.\" \n\n- Refinery29 \n\nContinued in the comments.\n\nLooking to close the gap and learn how to build a fat bank account?

these eat away at your returns. a 5% fee is highway robbery, and if this is accurate, it could eat away at over $800,000 in your potential lifetime earnings (using my example). \u2060\n\u2060\nTHIS is

In the middle class we have been taught to believe that debt is bad. That debt is mortally wrong. That we should work to become debt completely debt free.

If you can make a higher return investing your money than the cost of the debt (interest rate), then you're actually \"losing money\" by paying off your debt. This is part of the theory behind the strategy the rich use called: Buy Borrow Die. The rich will put their money into assets, like stocks and real estate, and use other people's money (loans) to live off of tax free. This is accomplished because the interest on the debt is lower than the return, especially when taking into consideration the taxes they would pay to remove that money as income (you don't pay taxes on debt, even if you're using it to live).

People don't usually seek help, or admit there's a problem, until it is greatly and negatively impacting many areas of their lives.\u2060\n\u2060\nThis is because admitting something is wrong challenges your ego, and feels uncomfortable. Most people will avoid perceived discomfort even if that means staying in their current discomfort (they rationalize this by saying things like \"but what if that discomfort is WORSE).\u2060\n\u2060\nDon't be that person.\u2060\n\u2060\nAfter admitting to yourself something needs to change, then comes step two:\u2060\n\u2060\n2. You seek the knowledge to change.\u2060\n\u2060\nMost people won't get there either. They may eventually admit they need to change, but instead of figuring out how, they'll let the thought of change consume them.\u2060\n\u2060\nDon't be the person that keeps saying \"I should start XYZ\" \"I should have XYZ\", just go out and do it.

Call back and talk to someone else. Our students have been able to take double digits off their interest rates simply by learning how to ask for what they want. \n\n2. Set the stage to negotiate a raise - yes even in this environment. \n\nStart demonstrating your value and worth, and show your boss how paying you more money actually means they get what they want (more sales, higher productivity, less stress etc). \n\nIf you can\u2019t get more money, can you get more things like better benefits, a better 401k contribution, or more work from home time? \n\n3. Call your bank and ask them to remove any NSF or late charges from your account. \n\nYes, if you\u2019re nice, simply calling and asking could literally save you hundreds of dollars for a few minutes of your time. \n\nWe are launching an all new freebie: Investing Masterclass. \n\nLearn how to start making more money without working harder, from a 7 figure mentor. \n\nMore details on our website, grab your spot before they fill up \ud83d\udd25", "total_engagement": 241, "engagement_rate": 0.0026220447597184292, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-09T16:47:52.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "students", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "customer", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "debt", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "situation", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072001259, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:37:59.162Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:37:59.162Z"}, {"id": 607775132072001258, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1183923574", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:37:59.160Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:37:59.160Z"}, {"id": 607775132219863470, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:50.221Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:27.227Z"}, {"id": 607775132219863471, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:50.229Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:27.233Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175094054043, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl9PCyOMx7E/", "post_id": "2989611889705819844", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/ede43752d30528dd33277e5cf7255433.JPEG", "phash": "d4a26ef284887eec", "image_entities": [{"entity": "jaw", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8276905417442322}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7311525344848633}, {"entity": "mouth", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5970986485481262}, {"entity": "pink", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22628335654735565}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2046317756175995}, {"entity": "chandelier", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.877663791179657}, {"entity": "chandelier", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.46426820755004883}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.45478034019470215}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.405355840921402}, {"entity": "flyer", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.26878446340560913}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T10:54:16.793Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-09T19:15:13.316Z"}}], "post_text": "INVESTING ISN'T A NICE TO HAVE, IT'S A MUST HAVE\u2060\n\u2060\nUnless:\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\udc49 Your parents are leaving you a fat inheritance\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\udc49 You win the lottery\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\udc49 You have a pension that provides you with the lifestyle you want in retirement\u2060\n\u2060\nThen you will not be able to stop working if you do not have investments to cover the cost of your living.\u2060\n\u2060\nWe don't just turn 65 (or 67 now \ud83d\ude44) and get to retire.\u2060\n\u2060\nRetirement isn't an age, it's a number in the bank.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe earlier you start, the less you have to put in, the harder your money will work for you, and the earlier you could set yourself up to stop working.\u2060\n\u2060\nI'm teaching you exactly how to get started in our NEWEST FREE TRAINING, an investing masterclass!\u2060\n\u2060\nWe are launching in January and spots are filling up FAST.

Let's talk about the different types of accounts you can use in the US and Canada to help you make more free money . First things first, before you decide anything you need to be clear about your goal - not every account or investment is right for every person. The key is to not only deposit money, but to buy investments with it. In Canada, we have a TFSA, which is an account you can use to invest and make money tax free, and there are no limitations to taking the money out. you could use this to save for a house, a car, early retirement, a gift for your kids. If you're saving for a house in Canada the new house you may want to consider the new FHSA instead and save your tfsa contribution room for other goals. In the US, if you're saving for Healthcare you could use a HSA to invest and grow your money for future expenses. if you're gifting investments to a minor you could use a UGMA. Other goals outside of traditional retirement would be invested for in a regular brokerage account. your earnings there are taxable. The main difference with these accounts is just the tax treatment, but as taxes are likely your largest expense, it's important to limit them where you can.", "total_engagement": 120, "engagement_rate": 0.0013055824529718321, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-09T21:57:45.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "us", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "investment", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "types", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "canada", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "key", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tfsa", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "anything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goal", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "accounts", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "house", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "account", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072001363, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:37:59.552Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:37:59.552Z"}, {"id": 607775132072001361, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-687577418", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:37:59.550Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:37:59.550Z"}, {"id": 607775132219863481, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:50.275Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:27.274Z"}, {"id": 607775132219863483, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:50.283Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:27.279Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175094054031, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cl_ql2FMwpj/", "post_id": "2990295996240693859", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/c39e3dffcf17e9f9904170d6c6946fd2.JPEG", "phash": "b1d86cc3339cdc26", "image_entities": [{"entity": "cheek", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8888858556747437}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8317950367927551}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7630093097686768}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7291772365570068}, {"entity": "facial expression", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7056216597557068}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6862272620201111}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5287995338439941}, {"entity": "internet meme", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5124956965446472}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4864860773086548}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3905287981033325}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3657938838005066}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.32895976305007935}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6440715193748474}, {"entity": "glasses", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5598876476287842}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3031037151813507}, {"entity": "flyer", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.26941248774528503}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2014973908662796}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T16:29:53.150Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-09T19:12:39.303Z"}}], "post_text": "DON'T MAKE THIS INVESTING MISTAKE \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 \n\nDid you realize that your IRA (or your 401k for that matter) is NOT an investment? \n\nFor my Canadians \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6 neither is your RRSP or TFSA. \n\nThey are accounts that you buy investments with. \n\nSimply putting money into this account doesn't mean it will grow. \n\nYou need to actually choose your investments and buy them with the money in the account. \n\nI've seen too many people think they're doing the right thing, when they're actually missing the most important step. \n\nHere's what you should be doing: \n\n1. Set up your account with a brokerage (they give you access to purchase investments like stocks, bonds and REITs) \n\n2. Transfer money into the account (pro tip: set up automatic transfers from each pay so you can stay on track with your goals) \n\n3. CHOOSE YOUR INVESTMENTS and purchase them with the money inside the account. \n\nIf you're just starting out, you can look into things like target date funds and asset allocation funds for an entire portfolio in one to make things easier (because good investing is actually boring and simple). \n\nThen, leave it alone and let it grow. You can build incredible wealth with these accounts, but you need to make sure you're actually invested to see that compound interest magic. \n\nThe last thing you want is to be years or decades down the road wondering why your account hasn't grown, only to find out you've missed out on the time you needed to build a fat bank account with less. \n\nTime is more important than money when it comes to investing. \n\nDon't miss out. \n\nWant to learn more about investing? \n\nI'm teaching you some of my best tips inside my newest freebie: Investing Masterclass. \n\nI went from $40k debt to a millionaire at 30 by learning how money works.

talking taxes, I\u2019m talking the cost to earn that money. \n\nHow much are you paying for gas and transportation and licensing fees and happy hour drinks and food because you don\u2019t have time to cook. \n\nAdd up all those expenses and subtract them from your pay to understand how much you actually have to spend, then divide this number by the number of hours you ACTUALLY work to see your real hourly wage. \n\nUse this real wage to help you make purchasing decisions. \n\nIs that really a new sweater you don't need (and don't actually really want), or is it 3 hours of your life? \n\nIf there's something you would have rather done for those 3 hours than working to pay for it, like going to the beach, doing yoga, or hanging out with friends... don't buy it, and invest that money

into investments that pay me out monthly. \n\nTwo of my favorite investments for cash flow are REITs and MICs. \n\nREITs are real estate investment trusts, and this is where you buy parts of a company that owns and operates real estate - and then shares their profits with you. \n\nDepending on your country, to remain a REIT they need to distribute between 70-90% of their profits, so that can mean great money for the shareholders. \n\nREITs are easier to start for beginners, because you can get automatic diversification with REIT ETFs (Vanguard has some great ones). \n\nMICs are mortgage investment corporations (otherwise called asset backed lending, or private lending). \n\nThis is where you pool your money with other investors to loan out on mortgages, and you get paid the interest (like the bank would). \n\nThere are many MICs I wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole as they're too risky (rule number 1 of investing: don't lose money). \n\nExamples of ones I wouldn't lend to would be ones that offer loans over 1 year, ones that lend on soft development costs, ones that do commercial lending, or ones that do large loans. \n\nTwo important factors to consider if you're looking at a MIC are loan to value ratio (ie. how much of the value of the property is being lent out, the higher the riskier it is), and the mortgage position (1st mortgages are less risky than 2nd or 3rd).

deposits weren't a thing yet), and the bank teller prompted me to get one. \n\nAll I was told about it was the name, Tax Free Savings Account, and that I should round up my purchases to start saving in it. \n\nSeems harmless, right? \n\nHere's the problem: \n\n\ud83d\ude30 You shouldn't be just \"saving money\" - if you're not saving for something specific (goals, emergency fund, sinking fund etc) then you don't actually need to save. \n\n\ud83d\ude30 The bank is paying you PEANUTS \ud83e\udd5c on those savings. Cool, you're saving taxes on $0.30. \n\n\ud83d\ude30 You're literally losing out on THOUSANDS of dollars in free money by not using the account the way it was intended to. The account is actually meant to provide you with a way to invest your money TAX FREE. \n\nThink housing is expensive? Wait until you look into how much you pay in taxes. \n\nThat's why it's important to reduce your tax bill when and where possible. \n\nHow do you actually invest the money in your TFSA? \n\n1. deposit money into the account \n\n2. choose your investments \n\n3. let them grow and make you rich It really is that easy. \n\nWant to learn more?

money without working any harder is by purchasing index funds, and if you are just starting out to make this easier you could do something like a simple target date fund or an asset allocation fund. \n\nLet's use target date funds as our example. Imagine you are investing for retirement instead of going out and picking socks and then hoping and wishing and praying that they do well, you can just decide what year you want to Is retire and then buy a Target Date Fund for that year. \n\nSo let's say I wanted to retire in the year 2050 I would simply search for target date funds with the year 2050 in them, and then start putting money into that every paycheck. \n\n(make sure you check the fees and confirm the history/strategy of the fund). \n\nIf you find a brokerage that allows you to buy fractional shares you could even get started with something like $5, you don't need a lot to start investing is quite literally a tool used to grow a small amount of money into a big amount of money over time. \n\nBuying the investments is actually the easy part, it's understanding how to set yourself up financially on the back end and understanding market psychology that will keep you making money instead of losing it. \n\nIf you want to learn more about investing I'm teaching you how you can get started in our all new free investing master class.\n\nGrab your spot on our website \ud83d\udd25link in bio", "total_engagement": 193, "engagement_rate": 0.0020998117785296965, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2022-12-18T22:47:01.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072001884, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:01.635Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:01.635Z"}, {"id": 607775132072001883, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-665479153", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:01.630Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:01.630Z"}, {"id": 607775132219863584, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:50.692Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:27.657Z"}, {"id": 607775132219863586, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:50.699Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:27.665Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175101624555, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CmW71kMN-kF/", "post_id": "2996845767797762309", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/f1cf6956a14972833c9d6ca596cac6b1.JPEG", "phash": "bc93133ec870227f", "image_entities": [{"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7263583540916443}, {"entity": "belt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.576808750629425}, {"entity": "driving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4008856415748596}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4000372588634491}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.36979347467422485}, {"entity": "headrest", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.29241660237312317}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2609030604362488}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2303779423236847}, {"entity": "baseball cap", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9177877902984619}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8703687787055969}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.42261698842048645}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4191661775112152}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3341539800167084}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23260845243930817}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T13:41:16.002Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-09T19:24:26.687Z"}}], "post_text": "I just watched a video that was super fucking dangerous, and I need to get some facts straight because listening to this advice could quite literally ruin your life - the scariest part is you won't know until it's too late. \n\nIn the video the creator said that since you're the source of every penny you make and money is unlimited you have no need for things like emergency funds, investments and retirement accounts - because your ability to create money is 100% in your control. \n\nAnd while yes I believe that money is abundant, and there's always ways to make more money - subscribing to this idea that you'll always have enough if you just work hard is bullshit. Believing that the universe will always bring you what you need without proper planning is bullshit. \n\nBy following this mindset you are actually making your life HARDER than it has to be. When you plan for life's shit, because that's life and it will always throw shit at you, you provide yourself the opportunity to take the easy route. \n\nAn emergency fund is quite literally for emergencies. let's say you get injured at work, can you make more money a different way if you get gritty? Sure, will it take time? Yes. \n\nHow are you going to pay your bills in the meantime? \n\nImagine your kid gets sick, or you get sick, and you're hospitalized, should that be a time you're focused on making money? \n\nNo, that should be the last thing you have to worry about. \n\nHow many of us have parents who didn't save for retirement and are going to have to work until they literally die or live in poverty? \n\nRetirement investing is quite literally a way to make your future easier and better. \n\nHow many of us wish we could work LESS? Investing is the best way to do this. Could you start a business and make great money? Sure, but it takes time and effort not everyone has access to. \n\nThe easiest way to grow your wealth, and build financial safety and security for yourself is by investing because your money grows while you sleep. \n\nFail to plan and plan to fail.

out for include: \n\nYour partner is spending money on your credit card without your knowledge or consent. \n\nThey are constantly asking you to co-sign loans or credit cards, even though you may not fully understand the financial implications. \n\nThey are consistently asking you to cover their rent or other bills, even though they are capable of paying for these expenses themselves. \n\nIf you're experiencing any of these red flags in your relationship, it's important to take action and seek help. \n\nFinancial abuse can be just as damaging as physical or emotional abuse, and it's important to protect yourself and your financial well-being. \n\nRemember, you have the right to make your own financial decisions and to be treated with respect and equality in your relationship. If you need support, there are resources available to help you. \n\nDon't be afraid to reach out for help. #financialabuseawareness #relationshipadvice #domesticviolenceawareness", "total_engagement":

lot of us the holidays are hard. \n\nThere were quite a few years for me where the holidays just felt like a reminder for all I didn't have. \n\nI felt stuck in life, like I didn't have the time, energy, money or support to do the things I wanted or live the way I dreamed. I felt like no matter what I did I'd always be stuck. \n\nWhat I didn't realize is that these feelings become a self fulfilling prophecy. One of my mentors early on introduced me to Angela Duckworth and her studies on success - and what I learned was that the greatest predictor of someone's path in life was their grittiness. Through my studies I came to know this as a growth mindset. \n\nI'm not successful today because I had life handed to me, because I had help and support, I'm successful because I saw what needed to be done and took responsibility for each of my actions every day. \n\nI realized that life was always going to throw shit at me (and trust me babes, when I say I've had my fair share of shit, I'm being modest LOL), because that's life - and I could let it break me, or make me. \n\nAt my last session after divulging more of my childhood trauma, my therapist said to me \"it's almost like you had to go through all those things to learn the lessons you did, to create the beautiful life you have now\". \n\nIt allowed me to take a little solace in the reminder that I could have chosen to stay stuck, but I used those situations to know what I did NOT want in my life, so I could craft a plan to get what I did. \n\nAnd that's the thing: each \"shit storm\" in life is actually a lesson, every time you fail you're actually learning more about what it will take the next time to see success... \n\nAnd although we cannot ever control what happens to us, we have 100% capacity to control the actions we take afterwards. \"If you're unhappy, move, you're not a tree\". \n\nYou may feel stuck in one way or another as we pass through this season, but know that you've survived 100% of the days in your life so far, and you can and will persevere moving forward. \n\nCont in the comments \ud83e\udd0d", "total_engagement": 134, "engagement_rate": 0.001457900405818546, "network_type": "instagram",

can make us happier if they align with our values and goals). \n\nIt's because having financial freedom gives you security, and peace of mind... It's because money allows you to build the life of your dreams. \n\nWant to travel the world without worrying about the cost? Money can help with that. \n\nWant to retire early and spend your days sipping tropical drinks on a beach? You guessed it, money can help with that too. \n\nBut here's the thing: money doesn't just magically appear in your bank account. You have to work for it. \n\nAnd while active income (money you get from actively working) is important, it's also crucial to learn skills like investing and negotiation to make your money work for you. \n\nTrust me, it's worth the effort. \n\nSo if you're ready to start building your dream life and increase your happiness, start learning how to make your money work for you. \n\nIt might take

brains can enter what's called a \"scarcity mindset\".\u2060\n\u2060\nThis is where we believe our current circumstances are forever, and there's no way to change them. \u2060\n\u2060\nWhen we feel like we're struggling our brain tries to tell us it's always going to be this way. \u2060\n\u2060\nThe key to overcoming this is working to move from scarcity to abundance, and from fixed (where you believe you can't change who you are or your circumstances much) to a growth mindset (where you know you may not have what you want now but you are determined to figure out HOW you CAN). \u2060\n\u2060\nIf you're feeling stuck, ask yourself: is this temporary or am I TRULY going to live like this forever?\u2060\n\u2060\nYOU GET TO HAVE A DIFFERENT LIFE\u2060\n\u2060\nI used my 5 step

It takes hard work (the hardest part is really just committing to doing the damn thing) and dedication to learn the skills that will give you a life of comfort and ease. \n\nSure, it's easy to sit back and let life pass you by. But if you want to live a \"soft life,\" you have to do the heavy lifting now. That means investing in yourself, learning new skills like negotiation and investing, and putting in the hard work to build a foundation for a better future.\n\n Life will always be \"hard\": being good with money can feel hard as you develop the habit, but so is living with stress, worry, or feeling like you'll never get thr life you want. The beautiful thing is that we get to CHOOSE our hard. \n\nMoney may not buy happiness, but it does buy things like safety, security, and freedom. And those things can bring a lot of happiness into your life. \n\nSo if you want to live a \"soft life,\" don't wait for it to come to you. \n\nTake control of your future and start learning the skills that will get you there.

It can be as simple as creating passive income through things like a high yield savings account (which I personally make $100 a month on) or investing in the stock market. If you're only ever working for money (aka using active income to grow your wealth), you're working a lot harder than you need to. The real key to success with money is putting it in the right place so it can grow and work for you - this is the concept of passive income. Don't get trapped in the cycle of always needing to be working for every dollar you make. It's time to start thinking like a millionaire and diversifying your income streams. And guess what? We're hosting a free investing master class to teach you all about it!

If you always depend on your job to build wealth, there will always be a limit to what you can make. \n\nThe easiest way to add more streams of income into your life is to invest. I got started in stocks and real estate, and although I saw the largest growth in the shortest time from my properties, the easiest way for the average person to get started is in the stock market. \n\nThis is because you could get started with $50 a month if you wanted and build incredible wealth over time completely passively. \n\nI spend about 1-2 hours a year on my investments, and now they pay me out over 6 figures a year. \n\nYou don't need to be good with math.

30.\n\nI did what most people are taught to do to get the \"good life\" but was still stuck.\n\nThat's when I realized we've all been set up to fail, and traditional advice (like budgets + working harder) only kept us stuck on the hamster wheel never making any real progress.\n\nThat's when I started studying the rich, and I realized they do things differently. \n\nThey're using the power of investing to get their money working FOR them.\n\nI devoted my time to learning everything I could about money, and using that knowledge I was able to:\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Pay off my $40k debt in 18 months\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Save my first $100k by 25\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Pay for my wedding in cash\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Flip my first home for a $150k profit in 2 years\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Build a $500k net worth in my 20s that grew to over $1M at 30 years old\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Buy my dream house, have kids, and live the life I never thought possible\n\nI've turned my experience into a 5 step method (MMM) that has helped tens of thousands of women just like you change their lives.\n\nNow I'm here to teach you about the sexiest step (investing) in our ALL NEW FREE TRAINING: INVESTING MASTERCLASS. \n\nIf you've

\n\nBudgets are the worst way to change your financial situation, because they're a bandaid approach. \n\nThey focus on showing you what you can't have (which creates lack and scarcity, which is NOT conducive to building wealth), and try to shove you in a box of who you're \"supposed to be\".\n\n They're a bandaid approach, they condense your financial troubles into a simple math problem, and research shows us that's not the case. \n\nThey're an externally imposed solution to an internal problem. \n\nThey're something we do to make us feel like we're doing something, but without the actual strategy, new tactics, habits, and knowledge to do something different WE WON'T MAKE ANY PROGRESS.\n\n 79% of people who try to budget fail. And when we do something and fail, it reinforces our belief that WE ARE NOT GOOD AT IT.\n\n And when we don't think we're good, we self sabotage, we get in our own way, we feel okay taking the \"wrong\" steps because we believe THAT'S WHO WE ARE. \n\nBudgets don't make you more money, they don't teach you how to pay off your debt, they don't teach you how to invest or negotiate or save. \n\nThey're the diet pill of the financial industry. When I ditched my budget and developed my MMM method, I was finally able to change my life after years of feeling like I was falling behind. \n\nUsing my MMM method I was able to: \n\n\ud83d\udcb8 save my first $100k by 25 \n\ud83d\udcb8 pay off my $40k student loans in 18 months \n\ud83d\udcb8 pay for my wedding in cash \n\ud83d\udcb8 buy my dream home \n\ud83d\udcb8 lock in my millionaire status \n\ud83d\udcb8 feel confident and secure about my financial future \n\nAnd now I've taught thousands of students how to do the same.

Read this.\n\nI remember working so hard to fix my life after hitting my rock bottom. \n\nAt 16 I dropped out of high school, moved out, and starting working full time to support myself. I was partying, drinking, and just generally f*cking up my life.\n\nI hit my rock bottom and decided something needed to change, that no one was coming to save me... so I got my shit together, got my GED, went to university, graduated with an almost 4.0 GPA, received a ton of awards, and got my dream corporate job.\n\nI worked SO hard to get there, and I believed that I would have all the success and happiness and money. But I didn't.\n\nA couple months in and I was still living in my shitty rental apartment unhappy with my life (with a neighbor that used to put JAM - literally jam - under my door handle every day, pour fish water under my neighbors door, and steal the lightbulbs from the hallway).\n\nI was watching everyone else buy houses, get married, and start having kids and I'm like... what about me lol. When do I get to take those next steps?\n\nAnd I let it burn me for a long time. I was so angry at my parents, the economy, the government, the schools - you name it, I was p*ssed.\n\nI could have continued to let that anger and jealousy consume me, but instead I decided that IT DIDN'T DEFINE ME. \n\nThat I got to have the life I always wanted, I just hadn't discovered how to... yet.\n\nAnd Babes, understanding YET is a powerful thing.\n\nWhen you start applying it to your life, everything can start to change.\n\n\"I'm not good with money\"... yet.\n\n\"I don't own a house\"... yet.\n\n\"I don't understand investing\"... yet.\n\nWith the power of YET I learned that I could truly have anything I wanted in life with the right time, energy, grit, passion and knowledge.\n\nStart using the people who have what you want as inspiration - because if they've done it, it means there IS a way... you just need to figure out how to apply it to your situation.\n\nSomeone else getting something doesn't mean you can't have it, too. \n\nJealousy becomes inspiration when you realize you're NEXT.\n\nYou get to have your dream life, and I'm here to help you build it.\n\nLet's make 2023 YOUR YEAR.", "total_engagement": 943, "engagement_rate": 0.010259702109603646,

cause. We got this post in our FB group last week, and she said she's making up to 3k a week but still living paycheck to paycheck. \n\nShe knows what she has to do, but she's just not doing it (she's self sabotaging and getting in her own way). I actually see this all the time - and if you relate, listen up because this is going to blow your mind. \n\nFrom the outset when someone says they're living paycheck to paycheck they think they have an income problem, But it's actually something very different.\n\n Because they don't know what the actual problem is, they end up using a lot of bandaid approaches like budgets, or restriction and shame to help them \"do the right thing\", and although they may see success for a month or two, they never actually get ahead. \n\nThis is because they haven't addressed the root problem, built their foundation, and are using approaches that are not conducive to building wealth. \n\nIn my experience being a financial mentor to thousands of women, it's usually an old belief or thought pattern that is wreaking havoc in their life. \n\nLike: \n\n1. they grew up without a lot of money, felt deprived as children and now that they have their own money they have a hard time saying no to the things they want. \n\n2. they grew up without a lot of money and haven't adjusted what feels natural to them with money, so they end up spending it, or giving it away because they don't feel worthy. this could also be because they inadvertently feel like rich people are assholes and they don't want to be seen as one. \n\n3. they don't have a secure sense of self, or poor self image, so they're spending money on expensive things trying to \"prove themselves\" to the outside world \n\nThere are so many more possibilities but these are some examples. \n\nThis is why the first thing I teach is mindset and behavior, before we get into the correct million dollar tactic to build your dream life - because if you don't address the muck beneath the surface you'll never actually get ahead. \n\nReady to learn a better way to win with money? \n\nLet's make 2023 your year. \n\nApplications to work with me are now open!

When you calculate all the hard costs that go into earning a paycheck (think licensing, transportation, work clothes, etc.), and soft costs (think vacations you need to escape, takeout you buy because you have no time, wine you get to help calm yourself down after a stressful day), it's likely a lot less than you think. \n\nWant to know the real number? \n\nTry this exercise: add up all the hard and soft costs that go into earning your paycheck for the year, divide this by 52 to get the average weekly spend. Subtract this from your weekly pay to get your balance. \n\nThen add up all the hours you actually work, and divide your balance by your real worked hours. \n\nThis is your real hourly wage. \n\nMind blown yet? \n\nSeeing this number does 2 things: \n\n1. It's important to understand the true cost of our labor in order to change the way we think about spending and valuing our time. Think about the things you're buying in terms of your real hourly wage - how long did you ACTUALLY have to work to buy that thing?

Show you that although you may think you make more money in a \"higher paying\" job, you may actually be able to take a less stressful \"lower paying job\" because you'd actually net more (aka keep more in your pocket). \n\nI teach you how to change the way you think about money so you can use it to build your dream life, and then share the strategies I used to go from $40k debt to a millionaire at 30 so you can get here too. \n\nApplications to work with me are now open \ud83d\udcb8 check out our website for more.

budgeting, and then you have success for like a month or two but then fall right back into your old habits, it's time to learn a new way to manage your money - because here's the thing, budgets are restrictive and don't actually change the real problems you're having with your money. \n\nInstead, you're going to use a 5 step process called the Makin Money Moves Method. \n\nThis is the one I used to go from 40k student debt with $0 in savings to buying my dream home, paying for my wedding in cash, saving my first 100k by 25 all while still traveling, eating out, shopping and enjoying my life. \n\nAll without a budget or working harder.\n\n I've put together a free e book for you that teaches you each of those 5 steps to help you get started. \n\nIf you want to keep leveling up, I've taught this method to thousands of students and they've used it to change their entire lives. \n\nYou can apply to learn directly from me and our team (we have co coaches, and even a therapist on staff to help our students work through mindset and self sabotage). \n\nLearn the tips, tools and strategies to winning with money and building a fat bank account that works harder than you do. \n\nCheck out

\n\nbut there's two key lessons I want you to take out of this that, if you master, you will have a happier and more fulfilled life.\n\n 1. the sunk cost fallacy - ever heard the saying don't throw good money after bad? \n\nwe have a tendency to continue on a path simply because we've already invested time and money into it. but here's the thing, if what you've been doing isn't working, the time and money you've put into it won't come back no matter how much more you put in. \n\nso it's actually better to cut your losses and move on. \n\n2. your real hourly wage - a lot of us think the number on our paycheck is what we make, but it's not. businesses understand this concept: your income is not your profit, because you had to spend money to earn that income. \n\nadditionally, you're likely working more hours than you're getting paid for, and this doesn't account for the additional hours you stress and worry about work on your \"you time\". \n\nwhen you actually do the calculation most people find they're making a lot less than they thought. \n\nI have other videos to teach you how to do this calculation. \n\nIf you're like - but Nicole I need the money to pay for my lifestyle, investing can teach you how to bridge that gap. Happiness is the goal, money is just the tool we use to get there (and you don't have to work for every dollar you need)\n\nThat's how I became a millionaire at 30.

\n\nI specialize in helping our students find ways to make more, save more, and invest more without a budget, working harder, or giving up the things they love. \n\nOne of my favorite strategies is negotiation, because you get to pay less for the things you already buy, and effortlessly save money. \n\nThe key to good Negotiations is showing the other person \"what's in it for them\", and then backing it up with data. \n\nIn most situations it's in a landlords best interest to keep their current tenant (if they've been paying on time and taking good care of the property), and this is because there is a cost to turning over a unit to get it ready to rent out to someone else. \n\nThings like: \n\n\ud83d\udcb8 vacancy (when no one is in the unit) \ud83d\udcb8 tenant selection/realtor/property management fees (which can be one full month of rent) \n\ud83d\udcb8 cleaning, maintenance, and painting These can easily eat away at the landlord profits for the entire year. \n\nImagine you were able to negotiate $100 a month off your $2,000 rental - that's $1200 in savings for you for the year, but this is $800 LESS than it could have cost to just get the unit re rented. \n\nWith every new tenant there is also a new risk to the landlord - will they pay their rent on time, damage the home, cause problems? \n\nIf you've been a \"good tenant\", then this is more ammo for your negotiation as a reason to keep you there (I'd take less money from a good tenant over more money from someone who damaged my home or didn't pay rent - and any good landlord would be the same). \n\nWe provide our students step by step instructions and word for word scripts to help them negotiate their bills and save Hella money \ud83d\udcb0 \n\nI teach you about money. \n\nLearn the tips, tools and strategies to saving and investing 6 figures + by working with me. \n\nApplications are now open, check out our website for more.\n\nLink in bio", "total_engagement": 153, "engagement_rate": 0.001664617627539086, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-18T18:50:33.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "students", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "negotiation", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ways", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "author", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tenant", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "negotiations expert", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "coach", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072003335, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:07.178Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:07.178Z"}, {"id": 607775132072003333, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-952661895", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:07.176Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:07.176Z"}, {"id": 607775132219863954, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:52.090Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:28.884Z"}, {"id": 607775132219863958, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:52.098Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:28.890Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175135670103, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cnmp6nFNmn7/", "post_id": "3019284947798485499", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/924f81c8db6edbd5958f266f24d09749.JPEG", "phash": "ad82138f1f38365b", "image_entities": [{"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5366426706314087}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.42891231179237366}, {"entity": "photo caption", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2789342999458313}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24344179034233093}, {"entity": "vehicle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2333783209323883}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9444990754127502}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.879673421382904}, {"entity": "soccer ball", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7245753407478333}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6965293288230896}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5982057452201843}, {"entity": "football", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.48799580335617065}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22592443227767944}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T09:59:27.530Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-16T18:07:09.087Z"}}], "post_text": "How to make an extra 500 - 1000 a month \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 \n\nIn this pinned video I showed you how to make 40k a year without working, step by step. \n\nYou do this by investing $500 a month, in this video I'll show you some easy ways to get this money. \n\nCaveat: if you want to live a soft life, you need to put in the work today by learning how money works. Investing is how I set myself up in my 20s to make over 6 figures a year in my 30s without working. \n\n1. First things first, don't go out and work more hours to meet your income goal if you haven't maximized your pay. Set yourself up for a raise and ask your co workers what they're making - in many places its actually illegal for employers to say you can't discuss salary. \n\n2. Look at the underrated options first - if the goal is to simply make more money in the easiest way possible, starting a business, affiliate marketing or air bnb arbitrage is probably not where it's at. you don't need something flashy, focus on what you know. \n\nThat could be something like delivery driving or bartending for a few hours a week (think 10). If I worked a busy night when I served I could easily make $500 in cash tips, and that's not including my hourly. \n\nYou could also become a tutor to make some pretty easy and low stress money, pick up jobs for handyman type work on task rabit or the like, become a virtual assistant. \n\n3. Take the time to upgrade your skillset, short term sacrifice for long term gain. You could learn skills that allow you to make more at your day job, so you can earn more without working more, and you could learn how to invest so your money starts working FOR YOU.\n\n You don't need to cut everything you love out of your life to get ahead with money - there's always a limit to what you can take out, but never a limit to what you can earn. \n\nFocus on maximizing your hourly wage, and then focus on maximizing your paycheck by investing.\n\n Learn the tips, tools, in strategies I used to go from $40000 in debt to a millionaire at 30 by applying to work with me through our link in bio. I teach you how to make more, save more, and invest without a budget or working harder.\n\nLink in bio \ud83d\udcb8", "total_engagement": 142, "engagement_rate": 0.001544939236016668, "network_type":

of. \u2060\n\u2060\nAnd actually, preventing ourselves from living our lives and restricting spending too much can actually cause us to get further off track by getting into a cycle of restriction and then binging. \u2060\n\u2060\nYou're allowed to spend your money on things that make you happy, even if that means your timeline for your goal is changed slightly (just make sure you're seeking true

It's not just about not having enough money or struggling with financial problems. \n\nMoney trauma can also be the result of past experiences or beliefs about money that shape our attitudes and behaviors around it. \n\nSome examples of money trauma might include: \n\nGrowing up in a household where money was a source of conflict or stress\n\n Experiencing financial abuse or manipulation from a partner or family member \n\nFeeling like you're not good with money or that you'll never be able to get ahead financially \n\nBeing told that you're not worthy or deserving of financial success \n\nThese types of experiences and beliefs can lead to negative patterns and behaviors around money, such as overspending, avoiding financial planning, or feeling anxious or overwhelmed by financial decisions. \n\nBut it's important to know that money trauma is not something you have to live with forever. \n\nThere are ways to work through and heal from these experiences, such as seeking therapy or financial coaching, building a support system of friends and loved ones, and setting healthy financial boundaries. \n\nThis is one of the things we help our students with, and the reason they're able to have such life changing success. \n\nWe know that being good with money is not a simple math problem, and if all you had to do was write down your expenses on a peice of paper no one would be struggling. \n\nThis is also why we have a therapist on staff to help our students move through their mindset blocks, so when we teach them the million dollar tactic (like investing) it gets to change their entire lives - instead of cycling through old patterns that have been keeping them stuck and broke. \n\nSo if you're struggling with money trauma, know that you're not alone and that it's possible to find healing and financial success. \n\nTake the first step by acknowledging your feelings and seeking support. \n\nApply to work with me to start winning with money and building a bank account that never stops growing \ud83d\udcb8", "total_engagement": 89, "engagement_rate": 0.0009683069859541088, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-20T16:41:41.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "students", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "experiences", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "problems", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "household", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072003488, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:07.720Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:07.720Z"}, {"id": 607775132072003487, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1871237134", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:07.711Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:07.711Z"}, {"id": 607775132219863983, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:52.215Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:29.000Z"}, {"id": 607775132219863984, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:52.221Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:29.007Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175135670099, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CnpYwuQrrgA/", "post_id": "3020053926451787776", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/bd3f1e153635363d6e2d884c2926b200.JPEG", "phash": "bcd303ad7092f893", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beauty", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7137893438339233}, {"entity": "black hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6659069061279297}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.509017288684845}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4663970470428467}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.430650919675827}, {"entity": "hairstyle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.416286438703537}, {"entity": "long hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.41572627425193787}, {"entity": "book cover", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4070512056350708}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3880564868450165}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8219043612480164}, {"entity": "computer keyboard", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5818397402763367}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.45796555280685425}, {"entity": "computer keyboard", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.42100927233695984}, {"entity": "knife", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.39775145053863525}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.389850378036499}, {"entity": "necklace", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.37797674536705017}, {"entity": "piano", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2587376534938812}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T16:29:53.495Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-16T18:01:04.014Z"}}], "post_text": "YOU'RE NOT STRUGGLING BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT WORKING HARD ENOUGH \u2060\n\u2060\nYou're struggling because we've been set up to fail.

\n\nYour career is not your identity, it's just a means to an end. Instead of searching for a job that aligns with your passions, find one that aligns with the lifestyle you want. \n\nWake up at the time you want, work from home if that's what you prefer, work with people or work with your hands, whatever makes you happy. \n\nOnce you learn how money works, you can use it to build your dream life. Use the money from your job to invest in yourself and your passions. Travel to new places, take up a new hobby, start a business, whatever it is that makes you happy and fulfilled. \n\nDon't let capitalism fool you into thinking that your job is the most important aspect of your life. We work to live, not live to work. \n\nDon't let your job consume you, find a balance and use the money from your job to build the life you truly desire.

\n\nWhy are men taught to negotiate, start business, and invest while women are told to \"budget and coupon\"? \n\nIt's time to break this harmful narrative and empower ourselves to take control of our finances. \n\nWhen you dont believe you're capable, you'll self sabotage and it will quite literally become a self fulfilling prophecy. \n\nBelieve you're good, affirm it, and then act in ways that confirm it. \n\nHere are just a few examples of the studies that have shown men's tendency to impulse shop: \n\nA study by CreditCards.com found that men are more likely to make impulse purchases online than women. \n\nA study by the University of Cambridge found that men are more likely to make impulsive purchases in general, with a particular focus on luxury goods. \n\nAnd yet, despite this evidence, we're constantly bombarded with images of men in suits, making big financial decisions and succeeding in the business world. \n\nSo, what do men typically impulse shop for? According to the studies mentioned above, it's luxury goods and electronics. I'd also add in things like alcohol, lottery tickets, expensive dinners and the like. It's time to break free from this limiting narrative and take control of our finances. \n\nWe don't need a \"rich man\" to take care of us - we are capable of being our own rich women. So let's start saving, investing, and making smart financial decisions. \n\nLet's fight the patriarchy and become rich b*tches. \n\nWho's with me? \n\nIf you're ready to build a fat bank account that works harder than you do and start building your dream life, I'm your girl. \n\nApplications to work with me as your 7 figure mentor are now open \ud83d\udcb8", "total_engagement": 45, "engagement_rate": 0.000489593419864437, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-21T23:05:05.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "women", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "narrative", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "babes", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mind", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "girl", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "men", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "studies", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072003646, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:08.231Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:08.231Z"}, {"id": 607775132072003645, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-978371037", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:08.228Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:08.228Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864009, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:52.320Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:29.114Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864012, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:52.326Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:29.120Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175135670081, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CnuYZ07scGJ/", "post_id": "3021459727951446409", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/5588d7408e0aa1c22423373521a9e878.JPEG", "phash": "b9b70b8598d0929f", "image_entities": [{"entity": "cushion", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8848397135734558}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6386273503303528}, {"entity": "belt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6385068893432617}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6376369595527649}, {"entity": "driving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6349458694458008}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6300031542778015}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5918702483177185}, {"entity": "headrest", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.554806113243103}, {"entity": "photo", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34477418661117554}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3385234773159027}, {"entity": "smile", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3025422692298889}, {"entity": "seat belt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21371527016162872}, {"entity": "transportation", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20769013464450836}, {"entity": "vehicle door", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20755521953105927}, {"entity": "vehicle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2018452286720276}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8410965204238892}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.33631590008735657}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22688770294189453}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22548896074295044}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T18:11:44.649Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-16T03:04:48.589Z"}}], "post_text": "Imagine your car breaks down.

different when it comes to your investments? \n\nGoing to a financial advisor at the bank with no knowledge of investing is like going to a mechanic without any knowledge of cars. \n\nJust like you want a mechanic who is honest and trustworthy, you want a financial advisor who is going to give you sound advice and not just push products that make them or their institution the most money.

only brought you a short dopamine hit, and then you're worse off than where you started. This was a problem I struggled with in my early 20s. I felt sad, so I'd buy some new clothes to make me feel better. I'd get a momentary hit of happiness making the purchase, but then when I realized I spent money I didn't have or could have put elsewhere, I fell deeper into that shame spiral. But then I'd feel like crap again, so my bad habits and coping mechanisms that didn't serve me would creep back up. It was a vicious cycle I didn't know how to break out of. The one thing I didn't realize is that my initial sadness came from the fact that I felt stuck - that I'd never own a house, that I'd never pay off my student loans, that I'd never feel financially stable enough for kids... And although I thought I was bringing myself happiness by buying more stuff, the act of buying things instead of putting my money towards my goals was actually the thing keeping me feeling like sh*t. What I thought was happiness was actually unhappiness. I'd go to bed every night wishing I was further ahead financially, wondering why I was making decent money (at the time $43k a year) but had nothing to show for it. When I learned how to break these patterns and change the way I thought about money and what was possible for myself, that's when I was able to change everything. If this is you, thank your \"bad habit\" for serving you, but send it on it's way. Start thinking about the ways you can derive the MAXIMUM happiness out of every dollar you spend. For example, a new dress would make me happy for a day, but the stress relief I felt from paying off my student loans will last a lifetime. We help you with the tactic and MINDSET (muck beneath the surface) to why you've been stuck, because the first step in change is recognizing where the pattern stems from. If you want to learn more, we have fr3e trainings to help you get started! Applications to work with me are also open. Check out our website for more \ud83d\udcb8 If I can change, you can change.

it comes from. \n\nBut first, let's define what the fear of failure is - it's the feeling of anxiety or discomfort that comes up when we think about the possibility of not achieving our goals or not succeeding. \n\nIt's the feeling that tells us we're not good enough, or that we'll never be successful. \n\nSo, where does this fear come from? It often originates from past experiences and limiting beliefs that we've picked up along the way. \n\nHere are 4 specific examples: \n\nIf we've been told repeatedly that we're not good at something, it can shape our perception of ourselves and our capabilities. \n\nIf we've experienced failure in the past and it was met with negative consequences, it can make us associate failure with something negative. \n\nIf we've grown up in an environment where failure was not tolerated, it can make us believe that failure is not an option. \n\nIf we have a perfectionist mindset, we may feel like failure is unacceptable and can be too scared to even try something new. \n\nNow, the problem is when we act on these beliefs that we will fail, it can actually cause us to fail. Because, we limit ourselves and hold ourselves back from taking risks. \n\nAnd the only time you fail is when you give up. \n\nOtherwise, what you've experienced is actually a learning opportunity - and the more you know, the better you'll get and the easier it will become. \n\nSo, next time you find yourself holding back because of the fear of failure, remember that failure is not a bad thing.\n\n I teach you how to hack your mindset so you can get rich, check out our website to start learning \ud83d\udcb8\n\nLink in bio for more", "total_engagement": 40, "engagement_rate": 0.00043519415099061066, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-01-26T22:47:40.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "environment", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "failure", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fear", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "anxiety", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "beliefs", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "feeling", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Family & Relationships", "confidence": 0.7675301432609558}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072003786, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:08.836Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:08.836Z"}, {"id": 607775132072003785, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "609777861", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:08.835Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:08.835Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864038, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:52.433Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:29.240Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864041, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:52.440Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:29.248Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175144067876, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn7dzJvL-86/", "post_id": "3025142633206902586", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/c38e83caca6ab57ac414a4a655253a83.JPEG", "phash": "b05f609117644fbd", "image_entities": [{"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8663610816001892}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8393306732177734}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8161353468894958}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7066226005554199}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5261489748954773}, {"entity": "photography", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5224720239639282}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.42939457297325134}, {"entity": "driving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4236457645893097}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.41766324639320374}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.37567999958992004}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3611612617969513}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.34322136640548706}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3015260100364685}, {"entity": "doll", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2988387644290924}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T16:46:50.727Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-16T18:19:59.747Z"}}], "post_text": "Money mistakes that will keep you broke, from someone who used to make them and always had $0 in her bank account. \n\n\ud83e\udd72 Thinking that my paycheck was profit, when really it was income. \n\nBusinesses know this simple rule: how much you make is not how much you keep.

have seriously thought about taking a job for less money just so you don't have to be so stressed this video is for you. \n\nI went from working a corporate job and hating my life to making 6 figures a year in passive income, and I was able to do this by learning about income funnels and the PYF method. \n\nHere's the mistake that most people make: they work, get their paycheck, spend it, and maybe save whatever is left over. if you are doing this, you will never stop working. \n\nWe aren't taught another way because society wants us to stay consumers, go into debt, and stay in the rat race for life. \n\nThat way big companies can keep taking all our money and the rich get richer while we stay stuck. \n\nInstead what the rich have learned to do is the PYF method, and they use that with income funnels to get paid money while they sleep so they no longer have to work. \n\nPYF stands for pay yourself first, instead of saving only what's leftover, set out your savings first after your base expenses like rent and food come out. \n\nThey take it a step further by understanding that saving money will never be enough to stop working, so they use their savings as little workers and put them in places that will make them more money. \n\nSo for me, I put my money into real estate so I make rental income, reits so I get paid like a landlord without the headache, MICs so I make interest income, and the stock market so I make money when companies do well - all the benefits of being a business owner without having to work. \n\nI've created a step by step method to teach you how to do this too, check out our page for more.\n\nLink in bio \ud83d\udcb8", "total_engagement": 1003, "engagement_rate": 0.010912493336089563, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at":

with your money and future, then this videos for you. \n\nI'm going to share the number one mistake you're making when you're trying to get your financial shit together, and it's going to blow your mind. \n\nTell me if this sounds like you: you're making good money, but you don't really have anything to show for it. \n\nYou have a good job, but you feel like you should be further ahead for what your salary is. \n\nYou see your friends and colleagues hitting financial goals and you don't understand how they're doing it. \n\nYou've heard you're supposed to budget to start saving, but everytime you try you end up having success for a short period of time, but nothing ever really changes. \n\nMaybe you've even thought about getting a second job or side hustle because you think that's what it's going to take to hit your life goals. Now what most people don't realize is that traditional financial advice doesn't work. budgets don't work. if getting ahead with money was as simple as writing down your expenses, no one would feel stuck. Budgets are an externally imposed solution to an internal problem, they don't address the core of why you're doing what you're doing, and why even when you know what you're supposed to do you don't do it. We all know we're supposed to save more, pay off our debt and invest, but many of us aren't. a budget doesn't look out our psychology or behaviors, it tries to shove us into a box that restricts our spending and shames us when we \"don't get it right\". A budget doesn't help us overcome our financial traumas, doesn't help us handle self sabotage, and doesn't teach us the skills that are actually going to help us get ahead, like negotiating your pay, or investing. I tried budgeting and failed over and over again, and all it did was prove to my confirmation bias that I wasn't good with money. when I finally ditched my budget and developed my 5 step Makin Money Moves Method I was finally able to change my life.

I spend a few minutes on this account a year, and I'll make hundreds of thousands in free money just by parking it in the right places and waiting. \n\nIt's easier than you think \ud83e\udd0d \n\nGet started learning with our freebies!", "total_engagement": 69, "engagement_rate": 0.0007507099104588034, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-03T20:52:18.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072004063, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:10.005Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:10.005Z"}, {"id": 607775132072004061, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-224928034", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:10.003Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:10.003Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864114, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:52.717Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-30T08:09:15.338Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864118, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:52.731Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-30T08:09:15.379Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175150974090, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CoOkvxksJUY/", "post_id": "3030521211985630488", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/1355562a39a2635e70e01a9e3702092f.JPEG", "phash": "ace34ba43633f542", "image_entities": [{"entity": "apparel", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9887813925743103}, {"entity": "beanie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9723777770996094}, {"entity": "cap", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9359337687492371}, {"entity": "headgear", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8824192881584167}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5777143239974976}, {"entity": "cool", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.568135678768158}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5305812358856201}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4535980224609375}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.37483474612236023}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3120230436325073}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30913689732551575}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2785099148750305}, {"entity": "knit cap", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.27806833386421204}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2743123471736908}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24265363812446594}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2032167762517929}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9309971928596497}, {"entity": "baseball cap", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7445361614227295}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.574421763420105}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3373408317565918}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.28568169474601746}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T16:00:12.481Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-24T21:25:12.537Z"}}], "post_text": "Telling yourself you don't have the money for that is a surefire way to never have the money for that. \n\nThis is because: \n\n1.

Today we're talking about something that I know affects a lot of us ladies: self-deprecation. \n\nNow, for those who don't know, self-deprecation is when we put ourselves down, make negative comments about ourselves, and generally have a lack of confidence in ourselves. \n\nAnd let me tell you, it is something that a lot of women struggle with. But why do we do this? \n\nWell, a lot of the time it's because we've been conditioned to think that being humble and self-effacing is attractive, and that being confident and self-assured is arrogant or egotistical. \n\nThis is something that men generally don't have to deal with to the same extent that we do. But let me tell you, this kind of thinking is total bullsh*t. It's time to start loving ourselves and recognizing our own worth. \n\nWe are worthy of love, respect, and confidence, and it's time to start believing it. \n\nSo, how do we overcome self-deprecation? \n\nIt takes time and practice, but here are a few things that can help: \n\nPractice self-care and self-love. This means taking care of ourselves physically and emotionally, and reminding ourselves of our own worth. \n\nSurround yourself with supportive people who lift you up and encourage you to be your best self. \n\nPractice positive self-talk. When those negative thoughts come up, try to counter them with something positive. Take risks and try new things. \n\nThis can help build confidence and show ourselves that we are capable of overcoming challenges. \n\nLearn that there's no such thing as failure, only opportunities to learn and try a different strategy. \n\nSo ladies, let's start loving ourselves and believing in our own worth. \n\nWe are amazing and we deserve to feel confident and self-assured.

If you started investing $350 a month into the stock market at 25, by 60 you could have built up over $1M in free money. \n\nThis million can provide you with $40k a year in cash flow that you don't have to work for. Want more money sooner? You can invest in dividend paying assets (like REITs or dividend stocks), and you can start getting paid out today. \n\nNOTE: If you're just getting started the better option is typically investing for long term growth, however you have to review your current financial situation and goals. \n\nReady to learn more?

So many of our students think they have a handle on what they\u2019re spending on, but through tracking their expenses they saw they were basically giving donations to billion dollar companies by paying for things they no longer use (like subscriptions), and things like overdraft or NSF fees for just not understanding when and how money was going in and out of their account. \n\nNext you\u2019re going to start to build an emergency fund. Your credit card is not an emergency fund, it\u2019s simply a tool that you can filter your expenses through to get perks, and protect yourself when you\u2019re buying (some cards have things like purchase protection, which is like an insurance policy for whatever you bought). \n\nThis should be a minimum 6 months of bare bones expenses. Keep this in a high yield savings account - I make about $100 a month for keeping my savings here. \n\nPro tip: if big goals stress you out, break them down into smaller ones. Instead of thinking you need to save 6 months of expenses, figure out how much you need to save each month or paycheck to keep on track and skip the overwhelm. \n\nThird thing you\u2019re going to do is pay off your high interest debt - anything over 6-7% needs to go, but I\u2019d pay off the highest interest rates first. This is called the avalanche method. \n\nFourth thing you\u2019re going to do is start investing for your future - investing isn\u2019t for the rich, it\u2019s how you get rich\u2026 and it\u2019s not only how you get rich, but the only real way to build financial safety and security long term. \n\nYour roth ira, 401k, rrsp, tfsa, those are not investments. Learning how to invest could build you hundreds of thousands of dollars of wealth with like $50 a month if you put it in the right places. \n\nI teach you how to start winning with money \ud83d\udcb0 check out our website for more \ud83e\udd0d", "total_engagement": 349, "engagement_rate": 0.003797068967393078, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-05T16:56:36.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072004207, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:10.515Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:10.515Z"}, {"id": 607775132072004206, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1580646619", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:10.512Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:10.512Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864154, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:52.895Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-30T08:09:15.517Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864158, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:52.903Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-30T08:09:15.524Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175150974079, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CoTUFXssoht/", "post_id": "3031855304124041325", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/d3fb252115eb4e42084495324a49288b.JPEG", "phash": "b8074ed8f28db70c", "image_entities": [{"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9846315383911133}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.937761127948761}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.834069013595581}, {"entity": "facial expression", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5862805247306824}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5820865035057068}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4565102756023407}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.40832972526550293}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.37455785274505615}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30755218863487244}, {"entity": "smile", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.28815868496894836}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22594520449638367}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.43329980969429016}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.359692245721817}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.35563260316848755}, {"entity": "man", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3551437556743622}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T16:25:07.287Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-24T21:24:21.407Z"}}], "post_text": "Saving money these days feels like an impossible task, right? \n\nMaybe that's because we've been going about this all wrong...\n\nBecause here's the thing: there's always a limit to how much we can cut out of our lives, but there's never a limit to how much we can make.\n\nSo, let me share with you 5 ways to increase your income and make more money:\n\nInvest in stock market funds that align with your values and goals.\n\nConsider real estate investments, like buying a rental property or investing in a REIT.\n\nTurn your passion into a side hustle or profitable business.\n\nNegotiate your salary when starting a new job or ask for a raise at your current job.

The value of this shadow labor is staggering: $10.9 trillion, according to an analysis by Oxfam. \u2060\n\u2060\nIt exceeds the combined revenue of the 50 largest companies on last year\u2019s Fortune Global 500 list, including Walmart, Apple and Amazon. And this is an important point to make, because while your partner may be pushing for finances to be EQUAL we know that the rest of life tasks (like the mental load or household responsibilities) may not be. \u2060\n\u2060\nIf you're feeling resentful towards your partner because you're paying half but doing a lot more, it might be time to start looking at an equitable way to divide things. \u2060\n\u2060\nWhat does that mean? Say both parties work full time, but one makes $100,000 per year and the other makes $40,000. There's a large disparity between what could be deemed \"affordable\" for one and not the other. Equal means paying for things 50/50, while equitable means contributing what is fair (what is fair will be different to each couple, there is no right or wrong answer). \u2060\n\u2060\nThis could mean you split expenses: - right down the middle - each party pays a percentage of their income - each party takes on different expenses - you split shared expenses but pay for your own \"extras\" But when you're deciding on how to split your financial matters, it's important you also consider the unpaid additional contributions that are made, like carrying the mental load (having to plan everything, pay the bills, make sure things are done on time, essentially managing the household), and actual household tasks like cooking and cleaning. \u2060\n\u2060\nWhen you split finances 50/50 but take on 100% of everything else, it could cause resentment or problems down the road. It's important to bring this issues to light and create a plan that feels good to everyone (I recommend money dates for this!)\u2060\n\u2060\nApply for our 3 month program and learn how to manage your money AND your partnership \u2764\ufe0flink in bio!", "total_engagement": 90, "engagement_rate": 0.000979186839728874, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-07T14:48:09.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072004382, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:11.118Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:11.118Z"}, {"id": 607775132072004380, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1329019585", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:11.114Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:11.114Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864198, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:53.083Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:29.819Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864201, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:53.092Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:29.825Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175157217414, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CokdrwbOu5Z/", "post_id": "3036682599037333081", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/f84b5dfc8439786e00cf5fa57e20a472.JPEG", "phash": "9d4167889c73565e", "image_entities": [{"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5421996712684631}, {"entity": "driving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5412164926528931}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3440987765789032}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30746468901634216}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2703200578689575}, {"entity": "rear-view mirror", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23568780720233917}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8695701956748962}, {"entity": "mirror", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3577631711959839}, {"entity": "baseball cap", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3337751626968384}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T11:16:05.066Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T02:46:58.481Z"}}], "post_text": "Realizing I don't care about climbing the corporate ladder in my 20s was the best thing that ever happened to me. \n\nI don't need a \"better title\" to feel good about myself, I want to make the most amount of money with the least amount of my time. \n\nI'm not here to drive corporate profits, I'm here to spend time on my passions, and with my family. \n\nLearning this helped me realize that I didn't want to live to work, and that I didn't want to work forever.

I know that you've been going through a tough time and struggling with some of the habits that developed as a result of growing up in a tumultuous home. I totally get it. \n\nWhen fear becomes your baseline for comfort, it can be hard to break out of those patterns and make changes. But I also know that you're strong and capable of overcoming anything that comes your way. \n\nOne of the things that might be impacting you is the tendency to spend money recklessly or not pay bills on time. It's understandable that you might feel that these habits are normal, given your upbringing. \n\nBut it's important to remember that anyone can change and make positive choices for their future. Uncovering why you've been stuck is the first step towards making real changes in your life. Ask yourself why these habits have become so ingrained and what steps you can take to break free from them. As someone who has always believed in you (and who's been there myself), I have no doubt that you can overcome these challenges. \n\nJust remember, progress is not always linear and sometimes it takes a few steps back before you can move forward. But never forget that you are worthy and deserving of a life filled with happiness and fulfillment. \n\nI'll leave you with a quote that always inspires me: \"Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.\" - Confucius. \n\nRemember, I'm here for you and I believe in you. \n\nTake care, Nicole xx", "total_engagement": 88, "engagement_rate":

What you believe becomes the results you have in life. \nSo if you believe you can't, or that it's too hard, it will be. Do you ever feel like no matter how hard you try, you just can't seem to get where you want to be in life? Our beliefs have a huge impact on our thoughts, actions, and ultimately, our results. Have you heard about the RAS (Reticular Activating System)? It's a part of our brain that acts like a filter, letting in information that is relevant to our beliefs and goals, while ignoring the rest. That's why if you have limiting financial beliefs, you're likely attracting more of the same into your life. A limiting financial belief is a belief you have that limits you in some way. Like... \"Money is hard to come by\" \"I'm not good with money\" \"I'll never be rich\" The first step to identifying limiting beliefs is to become aware of your thoughts. Pay attention to the things you tell yourself on a daily basis. Are they positive and empowering, or do they hold you back? If it's the latter, it's time to start challenging them. Next, ask yourself where these beliefs came from. Did you learn them from your parents, friends, or society? Are they based on past experiences or failures? Understanding the root of these beliefs can help you see them for what they are - just thoughts - and not absolute truths. Write down three ways your belief is untrue. Then it's time to replace those limiting beliefs with new, empowering ones. Write down positive affirmations that counter your old beliefs and repeat them to yourself daily. Surround yourself with people who believe in you and your abilities, and engage in activities that make you feel good about yourself. And remember, it takes time to change a belief, so be patient and persistent! Here's how you could rewrite them so they serve you: \"Money flows easily and effortlessly into my life\" \"I am financially savvy and capable\" \"I am worthy of financial abundance and success\" Write these on your mirror, make them the background on your phone, put them somewhere you'll see them all the time and say them out loud with conviction.

Gen Z grew up watching curated snapshots of people's lives through social media, and it's made them feel: 1. inadequate, 2. like everyone else is doing better. \n\nGen Z is twice as likely as the general population to compare themselves to others online. \n\nAs a top money coach I see this all the time - people think they're the only ones struggling because they're only seeing someone's highlight reel. Their new car, new wardrobe, not realizing it's usually fuelled by debt. If you're working a similar job to someone else and getting a similar pay, you're likely going to have a similar financial situation unless there's outside influence (like credit card debt or help from the bank of mom and dad). \n\nThat means if your Co worker just bought a brand new luxury car and you're still driving your 10 year old clunker, it doesn't mean they're doing better than you, it usually just means they're in more debt \n\nAnd 2. They've fallen into this black or white thinking, and it's causing them to forget that even small steps in the right direction will get them to closer to their goal. \n\nInvesting even $50 a month can turn into hundreds of thousands of dollars if they give it enough time to grow, and they have that luxury because they are young. It may not be enough to stop working completely, but it could be enough to work part time, or could be a life changing amount of money for a multitude of other reasons. \n\nLet's leave you with an anecdote, imagine you were struggling with depression and you had the ability to get therapy once a month. You know that going once a week would be better, but do you still go once a month to get those benefits, or do you just say well I can't go every week so there's no point in going and not get any of the healing or support? \n\nNo, that would be locking in the idea of never healing. \n\nSomething is always better than nothing.", "total_engagement": 130, "engagement_rate": 0.0014143809907194848, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-13T17:56:39.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "views", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mental health", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thinking", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "article", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ones", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reasons", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072004572, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:11.767Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:11.767Z"}, {"id": 607775132072004571, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1813813888", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:11.765Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:11.765Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864245, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:53.288Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-02T12:28:15.931Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864247, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:53.299Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-02T12:28:15.938Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175157217313, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CooHnBCMscv/", "post_id": "3037711416157194031", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/b8514e12b7dfe69560a2e4deff12febc.JPEG", "phash": "b1d20f0fb0687f15", "image_entities": [{"entity": "thumbs up", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.45405253767967224}, {"entity": "beanie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.38979077339172363}, {"entity": "cap", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3676516115665436}, {"entity": "cool", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2926158308982849}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20039430260658264}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9682064056396484}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9314972758293152}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8825876116752625}, {"entity": "mirror", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.857914924621582}, {"entity": "laptop", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7855105996131897}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6453999280929565}, {"entity": "baseball cap", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6203566193580627}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6035314798355103}, {"entity": "computer keyboard", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5627317428588867}, {"entity": "computer keyboard", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5296504497528076}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.41924169659614563}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2838152050971985}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T11:01:58.134Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-28T00:51:01.435Z"}}], "post_text": "If you're getting a tax return here's how you can use it to become a millionaire. \n\nFor context I'm a published author and top money coach - here's what you're gonna do. The average tax return in the US was $3,039 in 2022. \n\nYou're going to use this money and multiply it to become a millionaire by investing it into the stock market, I'm going to share exactly how you can do it. \n\nIf you've never done this before, don't stress it's easier than you think. If you can learn to drive a car you can learn to invest. \n\nFirst you're going to open an account with a low cost brokerage, Vanguard, Charles Schwab or Fidelity are well liked. In Canada I use Wealthsimple. \n\nTransfer this money into the account you open, you can do this by linking your bank account in your brokerage. Use a tax sheltered or deferred where possible, like a Roth IRA or a TFSA. \n\n*note: confirm your contribution limits before making your plan to make sure you don't go over. \n\nOnce the money is inside the account you're going to choose your investments. Always make sure you're diversifying (not putting your eggs in one basket) so you can lower your risk. Index funds are a great way to do this. \n\nYou could create a 3 fund portfolio with a US Index, international Index and bond ETF, or to make things easier you could buy an asset allocation fund. One I have in my retirement account is VEQT, buying this made me a part owner in over 13,000 companies - and now I get paid when they do well. \n\nI always do a market order which is buying at the price the investment is right now, or fractional purchase, which means buying a piece of the investment if you don't have enough for the whole thing. If you start this by 30, and add another $500 a month for 10 years, you could have about $100k by 40. \n\nIf you just left this alone and never saved or invested another dollar, it could grow to over $1M by retirement. \n\nThat's over $950k of free money. \n\nIf you kept investing, every dollar you saved would just make you a millionaire sooner. \n\nWe have a free investing masterclass to teach you more, grab your spot on our website under FREEBIES.", "total_engagement": 460, "engagement_rate": 0.0050047327363920225, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-14T02:58:44.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "money", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "context", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "author", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "account", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "millionaire", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072004695, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:12.894Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:12.894Z"}, {"id": 607775132072004693, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1200971479", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:12.892Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:12.892Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864253, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:53.329Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-02T12:28:15.964Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864254, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:53.336Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-02T12:28:15.968Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175157217306, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CooU7OBsyaH/", "post_id": "3037769979101652615", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/97d511354090fbc2dac20800c18e60bf.JPEG", "phash": "d02fbd4af4f28780", "image_entities": [{"entity": "cheek", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8389200568199158}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7937068343162537}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7449353337287903}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7157403230667114}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6652247905731201}, {"entity": "hairstyle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.46292269229888916}, {"entity": "boy", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.31604957580566406}, {"entity": "internet meme", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.27316534519195557}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.26811161637306213}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3801080882549286}, {"entity": "staircase", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.34236031770706177}, {"entity": "man", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.30488675832748413}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2834169566631317}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20218060910701752}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T09:43:12.611Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-24T21:25:34.928Z"}}], "post_text": "Hey bestie, Remember when you were younger and you always had to pretend like everything was fine even when it wasn't? \n\nI know it was tough for you, but did you ever think about how that could be affecting you now? See, not being able to talk about money problems can lead to some serious financial anxiety as we get older. \n\nIt's like we learn to keep everything bottled up inside, and even the thought of money can make us feel overwhelmed and stressed. \n\nHere are three examples of why financial anxiety can occur based on what we experienced as children: \n\nFear of not having enough: When we were younger, we might have experienced times when our family didn't have enough money to cover basic necessities like food or rent. That feeling of uncertainty and insecurity can stick with us, even if we're financially stable now. \n\nShame and embarrassment: Maybe our parents were always worried about what the neighbors or relatives would think if they found out about our family's money problems. We might have internalized that shame and embarrassment, making it hard to talk about money with anyone, even close friends. \n\nLack of financial education: When we're not allowed to talk about money, we miss out on valuable lessons about making money, saving, and investing. That can leave us feeling unprepared and overwhelmed when we have to make important financial decisions as adults. \n\nI just wanted to remind you that it's okay to talk about money and ask for help when you need it. We don't have to keep everything inside like we did when we were younger. \n\nI'm here for you, always. \ud83d\udc95\n\n #financialanxiety #mentalhealth #friendship #supportsystem",

Ain't nobody got time for that! \n\nThink about it - that extra money that you could have been getting in your paychecks every month could have been put to better use. Maybe you could have invested it, saved up for a trip, or treated yourself to a few extra spa days. \n\nBut don't worry, it's not too late! Now is the perfect time to reevaluate your tax withholding so that you're not giving the government more than you need to. \n\nTrust me, your future self will thank you.

Here I'm going to share with you 2 examples, the 1st one being investing $50 a month until the traditional age of retirement. \n\nThe 2nd one is starting with $50 a month and then increasing to $300 per month in your later years. \n\nThe second example is more common, as typically while people get older and advance in their careers, they make more money and have more to contribute. In either case, we can see that \"starting small\" can have big impacts on your life. \n\nThis is because TIME is what does the heavy lifting when you invest... so the most important thing is not how much you start with, but that you simply get started NOW. \n\nThe best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the 2nd best time is now. Trust me you don't want to put this off any longer. \n\nIf you want to keep learning, check out our freebie: Investing Masterclass, or apply to learn from me as your 7 figure mentor. \n\nCheck out our website for more \ud83d\udcb8", "total_engagement": 185, "engagement_rate": 0.0020127729483315746, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-15T03:55:20.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "examples", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "website", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "example", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "age", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "situation", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "case", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072004848, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:13.457Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:13.457Z"}, {"id": 607775132072004846, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1891673619", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:13.454Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:13.454Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864287, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:53.492Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-30T08:09:15.891Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864289, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:53.498Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-30T08:09:15.919Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175163367126, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Co0df9eLxhr/", "post_id": "3041185388039182443", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/0bbd1342bcd1fe5521dcffda6a6471e4.JPEG", "phash": "8d324c2379cea2cf", "image_entities": [{"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9712446331977844}, {"entity": "document", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8580673336982727}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6612690091133118}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3714693784713745}, {"entity": "facial expression", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.33656516671180725}, {"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.28764989972114563}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24245765805244446}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23647840321063995}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21735641360282898}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2168068140745163}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21462540328502655}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7318830490112305}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4853389859199524}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.39862170815467834}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2758197784423828}, {"entity": "man", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21272389590740204}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T09:52:37.488Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T02:48:24.484Z"}}], "post_text": "Let's talk about how our parents did things back in the day... You know, the whole \"go to college, get a good job, buy a house, budget, save for retirement\" spiel. Sound familiar? \n\nWell, newsflash - that advice ain't cutting it anymore. As a fellow millennial, I know firsthand how hard it can be to get ahead these days. \n\nI struggled with money for years, thinking I'd never be able to save or get out of debt. But then, I realized that the traditional way of doing things just wasn't working for me. \n\nSo I took matters into my own hands and created a new way to manage my money. And let me tell you, it WORKED. \n\nI went from $40k debt to a millionaire at 30, and now I've built a successful business and even became a published author, helping other women just like us take control of their finances and achieve their dreams. \n\nHere's the thing - we can't rely on the old methods anymore. It's time to think outside the box and create our own path to success. So if you're ready to ditch the traditional advice and make your own rules, join me on this journey. \n\nTrust me, it's worth it. \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcaa", "total_engagement": 514, "engagement_rate":

But here's the thing: getting out of credit card debt isn't just about learning the avalanche method or making more money (although those can definitely help). \n\nIt's about addressing the underlying reasons you were in debt in the first place. If you never get to the root of the problem, you'll be stuck in a vicious cycle of paying down your debt and wracking it back up again. \n\nThere are so many reasons why someone might go into credit card debt - maybe it's: \n\n\ud83d\udecd impulse shopping because you're unhappy at work and you're looking for a \"pick me up\" \n\n\ud83d\udecd overspending to fill an emotional void, because you've been struggling in your relationships and you just want something that makes you \"feel good\" \n\n\ud83d\udecd buying things you don't need because you feel like this next purchase will change your life, that you'll be seen as more successful, more beautiful, a better mom or girlfriend (spoiler alert: it won't). \n\nAnd these habits won't change unless you work on your money mindset. So what is money mindset, you ask?

Did you know that in 2021, women in the United States earn only 82 cents for every dollar earned by men? \n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg. For centuries, women have been systematically excluded from economic opportunities and denied the right to own property, access credit and financial services, and participate fully in the economy. \n\nFor example, did you know that it wasn't until 1974 that the Equal Credit Opportunity Act was passed, which made it illegal for lenders to discriminate against women when issuing credit? \n\nBefore that, women couldn't get credit cards or loans without a male co-signer, and were often denied loans altogether because they were considered a \"bad risk\" due to their gender. \n\nAnd even earlier in history, women were not allowed to own property. In fact, it wasn't until the mid-19th century that women in the United States began to gain legal rights to property ownership. \n\nThis means that for centuries, women were unable to accumulate wealth or build financial security through property ownership. \n\nThese historical factors, along with ongoing discrimination and gender bias in the workforce, have contributed to the significant wealth gap between men and women. \n\nIn fact, the average woman in the United States has only 32 cents in wealth for every dollar owned by a man. \n\nIt's time to acknowledge and address these systemic inequalities. \n\nWe need policies and practices that promote gender equality in the workforce, provide greater access to credit and financial services for women, and ensure that women have equal rights to own and control property. \n\nLet's work together to build a more equitable and just financial system for all. \n\nSo, when you suggest that women shouldn't have financial content tailored to them, you're ignoring the fact that women face systemic financial barriers that need to be addressed. It's time to acknowledge these issues and work towards creating a more equitable financial system. \n\nAnd until then, women deserve financial content that speaks directly to their unique experiences and challenges.", "total_engagement": 265, "engagement_rate": 0.0028831612503127956, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-20T00:55:44.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "united states", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "right", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "women", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "dollar", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "equal credit opportunity act", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tip", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "men", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072005020, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:14.038Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:14.038Z"}, {"id": 607775132072005019, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-330361205", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:14.034Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:14.034Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864322, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:53.643Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:10.443Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864326, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:53.650Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:10.454Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175163367102, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Co5Kx9OLEdx/", "post_id": "3042510436720985969", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/bd163a75fc7fa5c9ccda00e8a5fb331e.JPEG", "phash": "b9926d201bb9167b", "image_entities": [{"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7274600267410278}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6522164344787598}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5992734432220459}, {"entity": "facial expression", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.569221019744873}, {"entity": "belt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3885159492492676}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.38164204359054565}, {"entity": "driving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3703228533267975}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3437038064002991}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2731951177120209}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2531172037124634}, {"entity": "headrest", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2317148596048355}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5534464716911316}, {"entity": "helmet", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2959382236003876}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21067160367965698}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T10:15:53.104Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T02:47:17.447Z"}}], "post_text": "How to become the first millionaire in your family \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 Life advice edition. \n\nFocus on where you want to go, not what you fear.

Money is a tool, and making yourself truly happy is the biggest comeback. \n\nConsistency always wins, you only fail once you stop trying. Every \"failure\" is just an opportunity to learn and try again with more information. \n\nStop waiting for everything to be perfect, and to feel ready. Ready isn't a feeling, it's a decision, and if you keep waiting to feel ready your entire life will pass you by. \n\nIf you want something you've never had, you'll have to do something you've never done. If you keep doing the same thing, you're going to stay where you are. \n\nListening to advice from people who don't have the life you want is counterintuitive. \n\nWould you ask a fish thr best way to climb a tree? No, that would be silly - because a fish has never climbed a tree, and their advice is going to be biased based on their viewpoint. \n\nLearn from people who've done what you want to do, and learn

The magic of investing when you're young lies in the power of compound interest. With compound interest, you not only earn interest on the money you invest, but you also earn interest on the interest you earn. It's like a snowball effect, and the earlier you start, the bigger your snowball can grow. \n\nBut don't just take my word for it. Let's look at an example. Say you invest $5,000 at age 25, and you earn an average annual return of 7%. If you keep that money invested for 40 years, by the time you're 65, you'll have over $52,000. But if you wait until you're 35 to invest that same amount, you'll end up with around $28,000 - almost HALF. \n\nThat's the power of compound interest! \n\nAnd that's not all. When you invest when you're young, you have time on your side. You can weather market ups and downs and take more risks, knowing that you have decades ahead of you to recover from any losses. \n\nPlus, the more you invest when you're young, the less you have to save later on in life to achieve your financial goals. \n\nSo, why is compound interest so beautiful? It's because it's a simple but incredibly powerful concept that can make your money work harder for you. And the earlier you start, the more time your money has to grow. \n\nIn fact, did you know that money you save and invest in your 20s is worth twice as much as money you save and invest in your 30s due to compound interest? \n\nAnd if you're not sure where to start, don't worry.

This can lead to high interest rates and debt that can take years to pay off. Having an emergency fund can help you avoid this situation and stay on track financially.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Reaching your goals: We all have dreams we want to achieve, whether it's traveling the world, buying a house, or starting our own business. Building up an emergency fund is just one step towards building our dream lives. When we have money set aside for unexpected expenses, we can stay focused on our goals without getting derailed by unexpected financial setbacks.\n\nAt our 3 month Makin Money Moves program, we teach our students strategies to save more money and reach their financial goals, including the importance of emergency funds. \n\nSo let's start saving and preparing for the unexpected! With a little bit of planning and foresight, we can all build the lives we want and deserve. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udcb0\n\nCheck out the link in bio to learn how!", "total_engagement": 39, "engagement_rate": 0.00042431429721584543, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-02-22T21:15:09.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "examples", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "imagine building", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "situations", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "job", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "stress", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "car", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "couple", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lives", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goals", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "debt", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "cash", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072005152, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:14.491Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:14.491Z"}, {"id": 607775132072005148, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "681915905", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:14.489Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:14.489Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864360, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:53.805Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:30.427Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864362, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": null, "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:53.811Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:30.433Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175163367086, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Co-uh8lL2w_/", "post_id": "3044075041079651391", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/16e5402f91335178350f29fba93e240b.JPEG", "phash": "9d908fecb603e954", "image_entities": [{"entity": "driving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6557856202125549}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3924068808555603}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3782559633255005}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.37492281198501587}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.35383340716362}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.27321332693099976}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6055552959442139}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5245733857154846}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4684939384460449}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.29846230149269104}, {"entity": "computer monitor", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.26518404483795166}, {"entity": "laptop", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2553453743457794}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T16:50:13.994Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T02:47:12.543Z"}}], "post_text": "Money lessons with a self made millionaire\ud83d\udc47 \n\nDeinfluencing you out of money sh*t you don't need (and some of these are going to make a lot of people angry). When you know how money works, you can learn how to separate the facts from the noise. \n\nMutual funds \n\nThey're overly expensive and studies show they don't beat the market. That means you're paying more to make less. Instead focus on things like low cost index funds, ETFs, or asset allocation funds. \n\nWhole life insurance (IULs) \n\nThese are sold as a way to build wealth, but the only people they actually help are the 1% who already have wealth.

It's also not an investment if you've bought with emotion and have no way to get the money out (like downsizing or moving somewhere less expensive, flipping, or househacking - and no a HELOC doesn't count, that's just a loan that YOU have to pay back with interest). \n\nYou can get ahead without owning a home as long as you rent smart and invest the difference. \n\nI think you'll see a common theme here: that the best ways to be good with money are plain, boring, and vanilla.

If you can learn to drive a car you can learn to invest. \n\nFirst you're going to open an account with a low cost brokerage, Vanguard, Charles Schwab or Fidelity are well liked. In Canada I use Wealthsimple. \n\nTransfer this money into the account you open, you can do this by linking your bank account in your brokerage. Use a tax sheltered or deferred where possible, like a Roth IRA or a TFSA. \n\n*note: confirm your contribution limits before making your plan to make sure you don't go over. \n\nOnce the money is inside the account you're going to choose your investments. Always make sure you're diversifying (not putting your eggs in one basket) so you can lower your risk. \n\nIndex funds are a great way to do this.

With stocks we use what's called the 4% rule, meaning you can take out 4% of your portfolio (amount you have invested). If you had $1M invested, you could take out $40k a year using this rule. But if you incorporated some alternative real estate type investments, you could likely get a higher cash flow with the same amount invested (allowing you to be work optional sooner). For instance, on one of my MICs I make a 10% cash flow (this is interest income from loaning my money out on mortgages). This allowed me to make more passive income every year with less invested, which means I get to retire with more on less.

\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\ude2d giving money to friends or family when you don't actually have the capacity to \u2060\n\ud83d\ude2d signing a loan for your partner because they don't have good credit \u2060\n\ud83d\ude2d paying for things because you *techincally* have more money, even though it was supposed to go to something else These moves can wreak havoc in your finances. \u2060\n\u2060\nSometimes we do these things out of guilt, fear, expectation, love, or even sometimes because we don't feel worthy of the money we have (causing us to take actions that bring us back to the \"level we believe we're supposed to be at\". \u2060\n\u2060\nSetting boundaries in your life isn't about being selfish, it's about showing people the ways that they can interact with you. \u2060\n\u2060\nRemember: if someone asks you something and you say no, and they get angry, that says everything about them and nothing about you. \u2060\n\u2060\nYou're allowed to say no to things that don't align with your values, goals, or make you feel good.\u2060\n\u2060\nA good rule of thumb I've implemented is to never lend out money unless I don't need or want it back. \u2060\n\u2060\nI've also seen way too many women stuck in bad financial positions when they Co sign loans, or add their name to a credit card with a partner, and that partnership goes south. \u2060\n\u2060\nEven now my husband and I have SEPARATE accounts and separate credit cards.\u2060\n\u2060\n*I always advocate for having your own money and accounts, for a myriad of reasons.

But You are likely going to binge eat when you feel like you're able to again because you've been missing out. There needs to be a balance between enjoying your life and paying off your debt. \n\n2. It sounds like this couple may have different values in terms of what brings them happiness and fulfillment. When people value something they are usually willing to spend more money on it, and this may look completely out of whack to another person. \n\nSo for instance my husband really values coffee and convenience, so where he may be willing to spend more money on higher and coffee, or convenience items, I don't personally value those things and for a while did see them as a waste of money. \n\nIt's not a waste of money because it's in alignment with his values and goals, and we need to understand and get on the same page as our partner so that we allow them to be their own people too. \n\n3. Wanting to pay off your debt is great, but what are your other financial goals?

When you invest, you can earn interest on your earnings. That means your money can grow even faster without you having to do anything! \n\n3. Diversifying your investments can help reduce the risk of losing money. By investing in different things, you can spread out your money and minimize the chance of losing it all. \n\n4.

Fundrise in the US and Fundscraper in Canada allow you to own real estate without ever having to become a landlord. While the stock market was down double digits last year, I made over 18% with one of my investments with Fundscraper. \n\nNext I invested in the stock market, the best way to do this is to choose a low fee brokerage, like Td Ameritrade, Vanguard or the like, and set up automatic deposits everytime you get paid so you start making money on autopilot. Starting in your 20s with $50 or $100 can be life changing.\n\nThe easiest way to make more money without any effort or risk is a HYSA - if you don't have one, open one immediately.

biggest scams that they run is overcharging for maintenance to the home. \u2060\n\u2060\nContacting maintenance personnel to fix deficiencies in the rental is part of their job (the job you're already paying them to do with their monthly fees). \u2060\n\u2060\nWhat can happen if you're not paying attention to the charges, is that the property manager will actually charge you more (like double or triple) the cost to correct the problem. \u2060\n\u2060\nAlways get the maintenance agreement in writing (do they charge a fee on top of each issue, and if so, what is it and how is it calculated) so when the time comes that something breaks (because something always will) you know you're not being taken advantage of.\u2060\n\u2060\nReady to learn how to win with money without the

They speak up \n\nThey know their worth, and it helps them set boundaries with their money, ask for a raise with confidence, or get mistakes (like NSF fees or an overcharge on their bills) corrected. \n\n2. They set financial goals \n\nWomen who are never broke know that failing to plan means planning to fail. They set real tangible goals so they know what they need to do, and then take the steps to get there. \n\n3. They maximize the happiness in each dollar \n\nThey know that every dollar represents an hour of their life, and to make that trade worth it, they need to get the most happiness possible out of what they buy. That new sweater may make them feel good for today, but paying off their student loans or buying a home later on could bring them deeper satisfaction.\n\n4. They have multiple streams of income \n\nThey know that if they're only ever trading time for money, there's always going to be a limit to how much they can make, so they prioritize learning how to put their money to work and multiply it while they sleep. \n\n5. They invest in themselves \n\nWhether it's a new training to upgrade their skills and get a pay raise, therapy to overcome emotional hurdles, or a mentor who can help them get to their goals faster, they know that spending money in ways that you get paid back (emotionally, physically or financially) is an investment, not an expense. \n\nI'm a former broke girl turned rich girl, and I'm here to help you win with money. \n\nGet started building your dream life (and a bank account that never stops growing) with our free trainings. \n\nLink in bio \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc97", "total_engagement": 1901, "engagement_rate": 0.020682602025828774, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-01T15:59:22.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "women", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "women", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goals", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "confidence", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mentor", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "dollar", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mistakes", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "boundaries", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "worth", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "girl", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072005507, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:15.893Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:15.893Z"}, {"id": 607775132072005505, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "589788746", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:15.890Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:15.890Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864438, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:54.146Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:10.779Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864442, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:54.159Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:10.784Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175168195299, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CpQpxmMvgGM/", "post_id": "3049120675907109260", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/39c3d90ca98eae681ab950ae5fc73a6c.JPEG", "phash": "900167dbe4196f7a", "image_entities": [{"entity": "advertisement", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8931583166122437}, {"entity": "brochure", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3765903115272522}, {"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2978072762489319}, {"entity": "line", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24164368212223053}, {"entity": "paper", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2093309909105301}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2043929249048233}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8028940558433533}, {"entity": "flyer", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6038222312927246}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T16:29:54.154Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T02:48:31.831Z"}}], "post_text": "SHE'S MAKING $2K A MONTH MORE WITH HER NEW SIDE HUSTLE.\n\nIt's #WinsWednesday and we're celebrating our student Rebecca who just landed her first virtual assistant client!\u00a0\n\nThis means she:\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Has more money for her goals\n\ud83d\udcb8 Can grow that cash by investing it\n\ud83d\udcb8 Has more stability, freedom, and safety than just one stream of income from her 9-5\n\nWe teach you how to build multiple streams of income.\n\nAre you ready to celebrate your wins, too?

Imagine having the ability to work part-time instead of grinding away at a job well into your 70s. \n\nIt's possible, even if you're starting from 0 in your 40s! \n\nHere are five ways to increase your income and get closer to your retirement goals: \n\n1. Pick up a side hustle or freelance gig 2. Negotiate a raise at your current job \n3. Look at meaningful ways to cut expenses so you can save more and live on less (so you don't need as much invested for retirement) \n4. Invest in education or training to boost your earning potential \n5. Explore real estate investing opportunities \n\nBut here's the catch: high fees with mutual funds or a financial advisor can seriously hinder your ability to reach your retirement number. Don't fall victim to these sneaky fees! Instead, take control of your investments and educate yourself on low-cost index funds and other investment strategies. \n\nAt No Budget Babe, we teach our students how to make more, save more, and invest more.

invest in assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate that pay you money over time. \n\nAt No Budget Babe, we teach our students how to do this and provide the knowledge and tools necessary to create a solid financial foundation. \n\nYou see, one of the biggest misconceptions out there is that you need a partner or a higher paying job to become a dual income household. But the truth is, you can take matters into your own hands and learn how to invest in assets that will pay you money over time as they grow. \n\nThis can be done with even small amounts of money, and can help you build a solid foundation for your financial future. The first step in creating passive income is fine tuning your active income (money you work for), so you have funds to funnel into your investments. This could mean working on negotiating a raise, or starting a side hustle (both of which we teach). \n\nBy investing in yourself to learn the skills to make money while you sleep, you can take control of your financial future and achieve financial independence. \n\nYou don't have to wait for someone else to give you a raise or promotion. You have the power to create multiple streams of income and achieve your financial goals. \n\nSo, ladies, let's start investing in ourselves and our financial future with No Budget Babe. We provide top-notch coaching, investment strategies, and financial coaching to help you achieve your dreams. \n\nLet's take control of our financial future and achieve financial independence together. #nobudgetbabe #financialindependence #investinyourself #dualincomehousehold #multiplestreamsofincome", "total_engagement": 273, "engagement_rate": 0.002970200080510918, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-03T17:53:43.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "foundation", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "household", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "income", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "author", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "streams", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "husband", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "household", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "partner", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "coach", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [{"name": "dualincomehousehold"}, {"name": "financialindependence"}, {"name": "investinyourself"}, {"name": "multiplestreamsofincome"}, {"name": "nobudgetbabe"}], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072005613, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:16.267Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:16.267Z"}, {"id": 607775132072005611, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1723211382", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:16.265Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:16.265Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864459, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:54.241Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:10.851Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864461, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:54.247Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:10.858Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175168195286, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CpViJ4-pt86/", "post_id": "3050494535850712890", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/13216c9063462041471dd0bea974d65c.JPEG", "phash": "9573cceb66cc290c", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beauty", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9825007319450378}, {"entity": "black hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9705824255943298}, {"entity": "brown hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.966233491897583}, {"entity": "cheek", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9581325054168701}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8863281011581421}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8786760568618774}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8744475841522217}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5085377097129822}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4967021644115448}, {"entity": "hairstyle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.48269739747047424}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3725295960903168}, {"entity": "dimples", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.33409956097602844}, {"entity": "long hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.32639217376708984}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.32500308752059937}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30313241481781006}, {"entity": "teeth", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2066190093755722}, {"entity": "necklace", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9405246376991272}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5857794284820557}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4944583773612976}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T12:13:19.249Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T02:48:25.943Z"}}], "post_text": "I had a friend I worked my corporate job with - she bought a pre-construction condo and needed to come up with the downpayment (the downpayments for pre construction properties are phased, meaning you put down some at the time of signing, some a few months later, etc until you get to 20%). \u2060\n\u2060\nShe decided to take a second job after her 9-5 to make more money to pump up her savings. \u2060\n\u2060\nShe started working a few days a week after work and weekends, to the point that the majority of her life was spent working and she really had no time for herself. \u2060\n\u2060\nShe was happy to make the sacrifice (short term pain, long term gain) but it didnt go as she was expecting. \u2060\n\u2060\nThe problem is, she was only actually keeping a fraction of what she earned because of the additional taxes - but she was busting her butt to get it. \u2060\n\u2060\nThis can be the problem with working more to make more money - the proportion you actually get to keep after taxes are factored in (especially if those earnings are at a higher marginal tax bracket) may not be worth it when you see just how much of your life it takes to get it. \u2060\n\u2060\nThe best way to make more money isn't by working harder, it's by learning new skills, like negotiation and investing. \u2060\n\u2060\nIf you get a $10k raise by negotiating, you're working the same number of hours but making more money. \u2060\n\u2060\nThe additional taxes don't cause the same kind of drain on your life. If you make $10k investing, that's money you made while you sleep, so the taxes don't matter the same way. \u2060\n\u2060\nWant to win with money without working harder? start with our free trainings! sign up on our website under FREEBIES \ud83e\udd0d", "total_engagement": 54, "engagement_rate": 0.0005875121038373245, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-03T18:18:20.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "condo", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "friend", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "job", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "problem", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072005643, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:16.375Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:16.375Z"}, {"id": 607775132072005641, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-969930635", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:16.373Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:16.373Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864466, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:54.267Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:10.879Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864468, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:54.273Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:10.883Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175177632005, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cpk1gN8rICq/", "post_id": "3054801757728964778", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/ba845735caef6e75b1ac2e5aa91c8264.JPEG", "phash": "eac789805c37eb2a", "image_entities": [{"entity": "sweatshirt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7397566437721252}, {"entity": "eyewear", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6900908350944519}, {"entity": "glasses", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4826964735984802}, {"entity": "glasses", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9871662259101868}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.679604709148407}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5641288757324219}, {"entity": "piano", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5127854943275452}, {"entity": "computer keyboard", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5058977007865906}, {"entity": "computer keyboard", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4602408707141876}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.45612040162086487}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23902258276939392}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T18:11:44.898Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T02:51:52.300Z"}}], "post_text": "I'm exposing the secrets of the rich as someone who grew up broke and became a millionaire at 30. \n\nToday let's talk about how using this one simple hack the rich are able to get the things they want, like vacations, cars and clothes without having to work. \n\nThe way most people do it is wrong: they go out, work for money, and then use that money to buy things. If you do this, you'll always have to work. Instead, the rich switch up the order. \n\nThey start out by working, but they don't use their money to buy liabilities, aka things that don't pay you back, they use their money to buy assets. \n\nImagine you want a new car, and the payment is $400 a month. \n\nInstead of buying the car with money you work for, the rich would instead use their money to buy say an investment property that profited $400 a month. \n\nNow they have the ability to buy the car without having to work harder, and they have an asset that's increasing in value and building equity - securing their long term financial wealth as well. \n\nIf you want to learn more of the strategies the rich use, take our free investing masterclass.

work full time to support myself, to starting emails with \"hope you've been well\" and investing for my future. \u2060\n\u2060\nChange isn't always easy, and it can sometimes feel like you're losing things (like people), but remember that you haven't lost anything that's not actually meant for you. \u2060\n\u2060\nWe develop patterns and behaviors because they served us at one time, but it's natural, normal and OKAY to grow and leave them behind. \u2060\n\u2060\nChange can seem scary, but as I changed I realized the scarier thing would have been staying the same. \u2060\n\u2060\nWe get 700,000 hours in a lifetime if we're lucky, and I would rather look back proud that I took a chance than defeated because I stayed in the same place.\u2060\n\u2060\nI'm not the same person I was then, and that's a good thing (although I do let my wild side out from time to time). \u2060\n\u2060\nI learned that who I was didn't have to be who I was becoming, and that the world was LITERALLY my oyster - I could do anything and have anything with the right timeline, passion, knowledge, energy and grit. \u2060\n\u2060\nIf you're going through changes, know that you're not losing yourself, you're becoming the you that you need to get through this next stage of life. \u2060\n\u2060\nAnd the beautiful thing about change is that we get to CHOOSE how we change. \u2060\n\u2060\nWe get to build our dream life (no matter how big or far off it is) - I promise if you plan for it you CAN have it. \u2060\n\u2060\nReady to start learning how to build your dream life? \u2060\n\u2060\nI teach you how to use money as a tool to: - buy your dream home - pay for your wedding in cash - be free from your student loans - travel, shop, eat and do all the things - and feel confident and secure about your future \u2060\n\u2060\nStart with our free trainings: I teach you how I went from $40k debt to a millionaire at 30 living my dream. \u2060\n\u2060\nLet's make that you \ud83e\udd0d",

This could mean many big companies lose money, and may not have the cash available to float operation expenses like employee wages. \n\nThis one act could open the doors to further bank runs (where so many people are pulling their cash out of the bank that they don't have enough money on hand to cover the requests), a fall in stock prices, and a recession. \n\nThis all sounds scary, and it is, but there could also be massive opportunity here.

Read this \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 \n\nLet's talk about money disorders, specifically money avoidance. This is when we avoid dealing with our finances altogether, like not opening bills, ignoring bank statements, or pretending everything is okay when it's really not. \n\nIt can stem from watching our parents fight about money when we were younger, leading us to develop unhealthy beliefs and behaviors around money. \n\nFor me, I used to shop online to fill a void, but then pretend like everything was fine. I didn't want to face the reality that I was overspending and not saving enough to reach my goals. It wasn't until I learned about the psychology behind my money avoidance that I was able to make a change. \n\nThis is why simply having a budget won't fix your finances. To get ahead, we need to understand the root of our money disorders, the root of why we've been stuck or self sabotaging, and develop a personalized plan to overcome it. \n\nThat's just one of the ways we help you with your finances at No Budget Babe. Our trainings help you identify your money beliefs and behaviors, and provide you with the tools to overcome them. \n\nDon't let money avoidance control your life. \n\nStart learning with our free trainings.

It's a magical payment that shows up in your account without you having to do any work, just for owning shares (stocks) in companies that pay dividends. \u2060\n\u2060\nDividends get paid out when a company makes a profit (then they share those profits with the shareholders). \u2060\n\u2060\nIt's like getting the benefits of being a business owner, without any of the headache. \u2060\n\u2060\nNot all companies pay dividends, and just because a company is offering a high dividend doesn't make them a good investment (some companies will increase dividends even when they're doing poorly to try to incentivize more people to buy their stocks - don't fall for this trick). \u2060\n\u2060\nYou can expect dividends anywhere between 2-5%, but some REITs (real estate investment trusts) will pay more (I make 6-8% on the ones I own). \u2060\n\u2060\nThey may start out \"small\", but if you continue investing (and reinvesting those dividends until you need the cash flow) your account can grow exponentially over time. \u2060\n\u2060\nPeople may say it's not worth it because \"it's only a couple hundred dollars a year\", not realizing that over time this can grow to cover your salary and expenses. \u2060\n\u2060\nThis means you would no longer have to work for money, and that's a beautiful place to be. \u2060\n\u2060\nInvesting isn't for the rich, it's how you get rich. \u2060\n\u2060\nIt's also not only how you get rich, but the only real way to build long term financial safety and security for yourself (because we will never save our way to retirement).\u2060\n\u2060\nI teach you all about investing in our coaching programs, where you get to work directly with me and the team to create your own personalized roadmap to success.\u2060\n\u2060\nDon't know what to do next?

The move could signal that the Fed is willing to use its powers to support other non-traditional financial institutions in case of a similar crisis. \n\nAnalysts are predicting that bank stocks will bounce back because the banking system, as a whole, is in good shape. \n\nStock futures are up after this news.\n\nWhat does it mean when stock futures are up? \n\nWhen people talk about stock futures being up, it means that investors expect the stock market to go up in the future. Stock futures are a prediction of how stocks will perform on the stock market in the coming days or weeks. \n\nIf stock futures are up, it usually means that investors are feeling optimistic about the economy and the companies whose stocks they're buying. \n\nHowever, it's important to remember that stock futures are just a prediction, and the actual performance of stocks on the market can be influenced by many factors. \n\nWhat do you think about this situation?

a regular checking or savings account anymore because let's face it, that's a great way to LOSE money to inflation! \ud83d\udcb8 \n\nInstead, I invest my money and make it GROW while I sleep. Here are 5 reasons why you shouldn't keep your savings in a regular bank account: \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Low interest rates - most banks offer a measly interest rate of less than 1%, meaning your money isn't even keeping up with inflation. \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Inflation - inflation is currently at an all-time high, meaning the value of your money is decreasing over time. \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Opportunity cost - while your money sits in a bank account, you're missing out on potential investment opportunities that could grow your wealth exponentially. \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 High-yield savings accounts - if you're going to keep your money in a bank account, at the very least make sure it's in a high-yield savings account. I make about $100 a month off of the interest from mine! \n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Financial goals - if you have any financial goals, like retirement, you'll never reach them by keeping your money in a low-interest bank account. \n\nIf you're saving for something shorter term like a house, car or vacation, you could get that money into a CD/GIC to help it grow (I have a GIC right now from EQ Bank that is paying me 5% GUARANTEED over the next year \ud83d\udcaf). \n\nSo, how much money could you be losing by not growing your wealth? \n\nLet's do some quick math. If you had $10,000 in a regular bank account earning 0.05% interest, you would earn a measly $5 in interest after a year. \n\nMeanwhile, if you invested that same $10,000 in the stock market and earned an average return of 10%, you would earn $1,000 in a year! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 \n\nDon't let your money sit idle, invest it, get it working FOR YOU (instead of for the bank) and watch it grow! \ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLearning about money made me a millionaire at 30, and now I'm here to teach you! \n\nStart winning with our free money trainings, grab your spot on our website under FREEBIES \ud83d\udc97", "total_engagement": 192, "engagement_rate": 0.002088931924754931, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-18T02:54:35.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "savings", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "banks", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072006326, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:18.679Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:18.679Z"}, {"id": 607775132072006325, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1367593443", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:18.677Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:18.677Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864661, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:55.022Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:11.381Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864664, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:55.028Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:11.385Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175181672000, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp7585duLHw/", "post_id": "3061295245250048496", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/6b80e5499a643bb6d74f6c7f52ecdd78.JPEG", "phash": "d996e6e2a5169aa1", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beauty", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8526695370674133}, {"entity": "black hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8168805241584778}, {"entity": "black hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8130915760993958}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7175259590148926}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6902849078178406}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6259382367134094}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5149185061454773}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.46611499786376953}, {"entity": "hairstyle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4551835060119629}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3585326075553894}, {"entity": "long hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3205082416534424}, {"entity": "dimples", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.27298441529273987}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2580561935901642}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22111628949642181}, {"entity": "smile", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2037031501531601}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7988117337226868}, {"entity": "blouse", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7848221063613892}, {"entity": "skirt", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4979463815689087}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3464913070201874}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3434179127216339}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T10:33:10.008Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T02:52:03.756Z"}}], "post_text": "Saving your first $100,000 by the time you're 30 is the golden goose to reaching coast fire and retiring a millionaire even if you never save or invest another dollar. \n\nIt's probbaly one of the best feelings in the world knowing your financial future is set, and you can sit back, relax, and let your money do the heavy lifting. \n\nCompound interest is the key to building your wealth for you over time while you get to sit back and relax.

If you lost all your money everytime a stock market prices changed, no one would ever make any money. \n\nThe rich know this, that's why you'll see them piling more money into the markets when they go down - if you want to be rich, you need to emulate what the rich do. \n\nThe key here is that crashes are normal, to be expected, and will keep happening. It's not \"if the stock market will crash\", it's when. \n\nThe people who have the right strategy (diversified investing for the longer term), don't have to worry about stock market crashes, and can actually use them as opportunities to build MORE wealth. \n\nThe people who don't know what they're doing, are investing in individual stocks, are investing money they need in the short term, are speculating (aka gambling), or are making emotional decisions instead of data backed ones will lose money. \n\nBut that won't be you, because you're here taking the time to learn to do things the right way. \n\nThe best way to get ahead when investing is to understand that these dips happen often and to take advantage of them. \n\nThe point of investing is to buy when prices are low so you can ride them up when they go higher, and that's how you make money. \n\nUnfortunately, most people do the opposite and panic sell when prices drop - the act of them panicking and selling is what actually causes them to lose money, not the market. \n\nSome of the best days in the market happen around some of the worst, which means you can't time the market but you can spend time in the market. \n\naka

the stock market is so easy, why doesn't everyone do it? \n\n1.

Confirmation bias, people seek out information that confirms their own bias. \n\nSo if someone's only exposure to the stock market is the clickbait headlines in the news and the inaccurate depiction of investing in movies, they're going to believe it's risky and only the rich do it. \n\n3. Overconfidence in their investing skills, this is for the people who know about investing and ignore the research and data that shows the best ways to make money are diversified long term investing passively. \n\nInstead they will try to become a stock trader, going against data, even though data also shows stock pickers lose money. Then they will be surprised when they lose money (since the pros can't even do this well) and perpetuate the idea that investing is risky but really they're just doing it wrong. \n\nIf you want to learn how to build your wealth with investing the right way, check out our free investing masterclass. \n\nFind it on our website under FREEBIES \ud83d\udc97", "total_engagement": 622, "engagement_rate": 0.006767269047903996, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-22T19:51:46.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072006482, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:19.194Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:19.194Z"}, {"id": 607775132072006481, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "60534852", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:19.192Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:19.192Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864705, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:55.194Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:11.507Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864709, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:55.202Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:11.512Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175186501575, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CqIxaNXtIbR/", "post_id": "3064916851767412433", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/c9580829e4741191503f781ff49522b9.JPEG", "phash": "bcb9d12e9dce8092", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beauty", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9035173058509827}, {"entity": "cheek", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8703025579452515}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7376032471656799}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6641662120819092}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6620485782623291}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4347655773162842}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.36486130952835083}, {"entity": "hairstyle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3233918845653534}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2951866388320923}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2907602787017822}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.25317418575286865}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24470525979995728}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23750773072242737}, {"entity": "dimples", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2341289222240448}, {"entity": "smile", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21973055601119995}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5075763463973999}, {"entity": "mirror", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.47968119382858276}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.43675681948661804}, {"entity": "sweater", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3969481587409973}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T11:16:05.949Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T02:55:22.714Z"}}], "post_text": "THE REAL REASON YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH MONEY \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 \n\nIf you... \n\n\u2757\ufe0fCan't seem to save even though you're making a good income\n\n \u2757\ufe0f Self sabotage yourself everytime you start making any progress towards your goals \n\nCould be because you grew up not feeling safe, feeling like you'd never have enough even if you did, and constantly being in fight or flight. \n\nThis can cause things like financial avoidance, where fear stops you from opening bills, or having conversations about your money which can put you into debt or hurt your credit score. \n\nIt can cause you to overspend as a way to \"make yourself feel better\" and avoid addressing what's really wrong.

It's about them creating a moral panic to cover up for the fact that they don't want us to be connected in ways they don't control. \n\nLet me break it down for you: TikTok has allowed me to connect with over 1.5 million people and change their lives financially by teaching them things we should have been taught in school. \n\nIt's not an accident or oversight that we weren't taught how to manage our money, or taught that we HAVE to invest to be able to ever stop working.

They want us divided and unaware. \n\nTikTok allows us to see what they don't want us to see, and they don't like that. So, we're facing a ban. Let that sink in.

I thought I had it made. \n\nBut it didn't take long for me to realize that the traditional path wasn't going to cut it for me. \n\nI knew I had to make a change, but I wasn't sure what that meant. I could keep going down the path that felt easy, but unfulfilling, or I could choose a different path. \n\nOne that would take some work, but had the potential to lead me to true happiness and financial independence. I decided to take the latter route. \n\nI realized that the \"easy\" route was actually harder in its own ways - because for me, living a life of unhappiness (where happiness is quite literally the only purpose of life), was a hard I wasn't willing to accept. \n\nWaking up every day hating what I was doing was too hard. Taking the other path felt \"hard\" in the beginning, because it was new. It meant learning about investing and real estate, and taking risks that I never thought I'd take (like leaving that cushy corporate job to work a commission only job in real estate). \n\nBut it also meant setting myself up for financial freedom, so I could live life on my own terms. I remember the first time I invested in real estate. It was a little nerve-wracking, but also exhilarating. \n\nFrom there, I continued to learn and grow, taking calculated risks and making smart investments in the stock market. Now, I'm proud to say that I've reached financial independence. \n\nI have the freedom to live life on my own terms, and pursue my passions without being tied down to a traditional corporate job. I don't have to ask permission to do the things I need to or want to do in life, and that my friends, is happiness to me. \n\nIf you're feeling stuck or unfulfilled, I encourage you to consider taking a different path. It might not be easy, but neither is living a life you're unhappy with - always wondering what could have been. It could be the best decision you ever make. \n\nDon't be afraid to take risks, learn about investing, and set yourself up for financial freedom. \n\nYou deserve to live the life you've always dreamed of. \n\n\ud83d\udcb8 start learning about money with our free trainings, on our website under FREEBIES \ud83d\udc97", "total_engagement": 631, "engagement_rate": 0.006865187731876884, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-03-25T14:47:05.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072006620, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:19.605Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:19.605Z"}, {"id": 607775132072006619, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1292437013", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:19.603Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:19.603Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864749, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:55.296Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:11.603Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864750, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:55.302Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:11.608Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175186501571, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CqQYvnvNdkG/", "post_id": "3067060171838970118", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/48040029c851595b85f3b655f4b9690c.JPEG", "phash": "bd920f7dc860470f", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beauty", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9660927057266235}, {"entity": "cheek", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8333663940429688}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.656582772731781}, {"entity": "belt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6231687664985657}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6060816049575806}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5432416796684265}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5307644605636597}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5054283142089844}, {"entity": "driving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.41695743799209595}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4073528051376343}, {"entity": "headrest", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.38294723629951477}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.35457611083984375}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.35220423340797424}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34156709909439087}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23964060842990875}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7916739583015442}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7276202440261841}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5614851117134094}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2956453859806061}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T12:13:20.081Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T02:54:13.776Z"}}], "post_text": "Products are not an identity but they're sold as one.. \n\nLet's talk about feeling like we are always one purchase away from happiness, and the Diderot effect. \n\nHave you ever bought a new handbag and then suddenly felt like your whole wardrobe was outdated? Or maybe you got a new iPhone and all of a sudden your laptop just wasn't cutting it anymore? \n\nWell, welcome to the wild world of the Diderot Effect. This phenomenon is named after a French philosopher who noticed that having one fancy new item often leads to wanting more and more luxurious possessions. \n\nIt's like a never-ending cycle of consumption and materialism that can leave you feeling unsatisfied and unhappy. \n\nBut don't worry, you're not alone in this! We all fall into this trap from time to time, but the key to overcoming it is to be mindful and intentional about your purchases. \n\nHere are a few tips for breaking free from the Diderot Effect: \n\nMake a list of your needs and wants: Before you make a purchase, take a moment to think about what you actually need and what you just want. \n\nPractice gratitude: Instead of always focusing on what you don't have, take a moment to appreciate what you do have. \n\nInvest in experiences: Instead of always buying things, consider investing in experiences that will bring you joy and happiness. \n\nDon't let the Diderot Effect hold you back! By being intentional about your purchases and focusing on what truly brings you happiness, you'll be able to break free from this cycle and live a more fulfilling life. \n\nStart learning how to win with money with our free trainings.

I just saw this last night and I died. this creator was telling people they could start investing with $0 by using credit cards, saying they help people do that all the time. that is criminal.\u2060 \u2060 \n\n2. investing money into real estate in developing countries and expecting a 50% cash return annually. so if they invested 100k they're expecting to be paid out a return of $50k a year. this is just a scam. don't do this. \u2060 \u2060 \n\n3. that you should invest in start up companies and IPOs. 96% of IPOs are unsuccessful, which means you have a great shot at losing money. Investing in individual companies is gambling, and this is incredibly more risky. \u2060 \u2060 \n\nIf you're not happy to lose the money you put in, don't. \n\nWe teach strategies to buy the entire stock market- and the entire stock market goes up by an average of 10% a year. It's a great return and a strategy that's been proven to help you actually win. \u2060 \u2060 \n\n3. that you can become a millionaire in a year. unless you win the lottery, start a business that earns $1M profit in a year, or gamble and get really lucky, that's not happening. my climb to millionaire took close to a decade, and I utilized leverage (aka other people's money, aka bank loans) to get above average returns. you can become a millionaire in your lifetime, but you need to invest to get there. \n\nIf you want to become a millionaire with less money, invest and let time grow your wealth, if you want to get richer faster you need to put in more money or use leverage (leverage can make things riskier). \u2060 \u2060 \n\n4. that you should put all your money into crypto. don't do this. it's gambling. you know how I always say not to buy individual stocks because they're too risky? this is the same thing but times a million. don't put in money you're not happy to lose. \u2060 \u2060 \n\n5. using the equity in your home to invest.\u2060 \u2060THIS IS NOT FREE MONEY, it's a LOAN secured by your SHELTER. \n\nBe careful out there.\n\nIf you want to learn the right way to win with money, start learning with our free trainings.

Always carry a balance on your credit card, it helps build your credit score. \n\n2. Always choose mutual funds for your investments, they're the best. \n\n3. Buying a home is always better than renting. \n\n4. Always use general guidelines to calculate your retirement number, aka saving 10% of your income. \n\n5. Always sell your investments when the market drops so you don't lose more. \n\n.... APRIL FOOLS. \n\nThis is all horrible advice, please do not follow it. \n\n1. Don't carry a balance - this was a lie designed to make credit card companies richer, not you. \n\n2. Mutual funds are unnecessarily expensive, and don't beat the market. You pay more to make less. \n\n3. Buying a home is not right for everyone in every situation, it is not a \"get rich quick\" path, but it can bring an emotional ROI and feelings of security (it did for me!). \n\n*note: you can use your primary residence to build wealth but you need to be intentional with your strategy, like house hacking or flipping \n\n4. Using general guidelines for your retirement savings means you're following someone else's plan, not the one that works for YOU. \n\nMaybe you need more, maybe you need less - if you never work out the numbers you're just hoping you get there (this is a WISH not a plan). \n\n5. Selling your investments when the market is dropping is quite literally what causes you to lose money. \n\nThe market will always drop, and go back up etc. That's how it works. This is why we diversify and invest long term. \n\nLearn how to win with money without the BS with our free trainings. \n\nGrab your spot on our website under FREEBIES \ud83d\udc97", "total_engagement": 303, "engagement_rate": 0.0032965956937538758, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-01T14:53:14.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "balance", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "funds", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "fire", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "advice", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "market", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "guidelines", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "home", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072006839, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:20.431Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:20.431Z"}, {"id": 607775132072006837, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1812108697", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:20.429Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:20.429Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864814, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:55.544Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:11.800Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864817, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:55.555Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:11.807Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175190289672, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CqiiEJZuVut/", "post_id": "3072167714374638509", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/47b3f6f89dd60ff0f968a2b2286b5f7b.JPEG", "phash": "b9d6c3299553ec11", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beard", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9339420795440674}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9258381128311157}, {"entity": "cool", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7842574715614319}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.734268307685852}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6255338788032532}, {"entity": "facial hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5301666855812073}, {"entity": "driving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5274121761322021}, {"entity": "laughing", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5160217881202698}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.48798155784606934}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3586687445640564}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.32333114743232727}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2655482590198517}, {"entity": "teeth", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2386641800403595}, {"entity": "moustache", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23835866153240204}, {"entity": "photography", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22950316965579987}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20553070306777954}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5641676783561707}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5454738140106201}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4658038914203644}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3607284426689148}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2847503125667572}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.27122625708580017}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2594829201698303}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24095644056797028}, {"entity": "single-lens reflex camera", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2398442029953003}, {"entity": "soccer ball", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20399005711078644}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T09:52:38.321Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T02:58:38.169Z"}}], "post_text": "It is a scam, and this isn't by accident.

Graduate with massive student debt, but the first thing you should do isn't pay those off, it's buy yourself a brand new car as a graduation present. \n\nDoesn't matter that you'll probably owe more than the car is worth in a couple years, and you'll be stuck with a car that's too expensive and no way to get rid of it. \n\nThen you should get married. You'll probably end up spending about 6 months to a year of your salary on credit on this single day that you'll be too busy to actually enjoy.\n\n So you're starting your new life together in debt that most people are still paying for when they get divorced a decade later. Then you'll buy a house. Doesn't matter that this is the largest financial decision you'll ever make, society tells you to choose with emotion only. Ignore the financial aspect. \n\nSpend what the bank tells you that you can afford. \n\nThen you'll need to keep up with your neighbors and friends because if they have something you don't, that means you're failing, that you're not good enough. \n\nThe measure of your success in life to society is how much crap you could accumulate. Do you see what they're doing? \n\nThey're creating a \"moral dilemma\", one where they say there's something wrong with you or you're not a good person if you don't do X Y and Z. This is the most powerful manipulation tactic, it's been studied and proven. \n\nAnd the things they're getting you to do? They're all to get you to spend tomorrow's dollar today, so you always owe someone. You can never stop working, you can never own your life or have autonomy over your time because they own you, because you owe them. \n\nThe way out is to learn how money works, heal your relationship with money, and then use it to create streams of income that pay you without you working. \n\nThat's what I did, I make 6 figures a year without working.

It also doesn't mean that it's a simple path to wealth. \n\n1st and foremost your home is a shelter, it's an expense and a liability that takes money from you every month. You pay for it, it doesn't pay you. Can you use your home to build massive wealth? Yes, but you need to buy your house with wealth building strategies in mind. \n\nThose are things like house hacking or flipping. Using these kind of strategies is how I was able to make hundreds of thousands of dollars tax free with my properties. \n\nThe thing is, the way most people buy homes is with emotion only. They are just assuming that because they're buying a house it's a good financial choice, but in a lot of cases it's not. I've worked with a lot of clients that even in a rising housing market had lost money when selling their home. \n\nOn paper it may have looked like they made money come up when you factored in all of the costs, they actually lost. \n\nWhen you buy a home you need to be purchasing it the same way that you would be investing in the stock market period from a defensive standpoint. You can't control what the market does, but you can control your actions to safeguard yourself and your investment. \n\nYour primary residence is likely the largest financial purchase you will ever make, it's important to look at the numbers. If it only provides an emotional ROI that's OK, but you need to be prepared for what the actual financial cost will be. (and not be under the false assumption that you will just always make money). \n\nThis means you need to be buying for the longer term, meaning 5 years or more, and you need to be considering any changes to your income that could impact your ability to pay for the property at the price you're purchasing it. \n\nFor instance, are you thinking about having a baby in the short term, taking time off work, going back to school, taking a sabbatical? \n\nThese can all impact the price point that you should be considering when buying a home. \n\nDon't let buying a home prevent you from making

That\u2019s over $900k of free money. \n\nDon\u2019t have $200 at 25? That\u2019s okay, many people start smaller and save more as they get older (however if you can front load your investments, meaning saving more while you\u2019re younger, you can actually build more wealth with less money because it has more time to grow). \n\nLearn how to turn small amounts of money into a lot of money with our FREE INVESTING MASTERCLASS \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25

millionaire. \n\nStocks: This is where you buy a piece of a company and become a part owner, then you get paid when they do well. \n\nBonds: This is when you loan your money to the government or a company, and you get paid interest. \n\nIndex Funds/ETFs: These are baskets of stocks. Instead of trying to figure out which one company is best, you can just buy one of these. \n\nMutual Funds: These are also baskets of stocks, but they're high fee and they don't beat the market. So you pay more to make less. \n\nDividends: This is when companies share their profits with you, it's money that just shows up into your account for you owning the stock. \n\nCapital Gains: This is the profit you make when you sell a stock or other investment for more than you bought it. So if you bought a stock for $50 and sold it for $100, you'd have a $50 capital gain. \n\nVolatility: This is when the price of an investment goes up and down quickly, in the short term stock prices change a lot, the long term is where you make money (5+ years). \n\nPortfolio: This is the collection of investments that you have. \n\nDiversifying: This is when you spread out your money so you reduce your risk, it means not putting all your eggs in one basket. To do this you can get different types of investments, in different industries, in different countries, over time. \n\nAsset Allocation: This is how much you have of each type of investment.

Do you have any high interest debt, and if so did you make any progress in paying it off? \n\nIf you've been using restriction as your debt repayment strategy, know that this never works long term and could be the reason you're feeling stuck. \n\n2. Did you save an emergency fund, or replenish one you used? \n\nYou should be focusing on starting your emergency fund before paying down your debt, sounds counterintuitive but it actually helps break the cycle. \n\n3. Did you invest for retirement or future goals? \n\nInvesting isn't a nice to have, it's a must have if you ever want to stop working. it's also the easiest way to make more money without working harder. \n\n4. Did you negotiate your salary or find ways to make more money? \n\nThere's always a limit to how much you can cut out of your life, but never a limit to how much you can earn. \n\n5. Did you get closer to your life goals like traveling or buying a house? \n\nMoney isn't just for saving, it's for having fun and creating our dream life. being good with money and enjoying your life is not mutually exclusive. \n\n6. Did you increase your financial literacy or learn more about how money works? Money is a skill, no one is born knowing how to win with money, but with the right strategy you can build the life you've always wanted. \n\nI'm your 7 figure mentor here to help you use money as a tool to build your dream life. \n\nStart learning with our free trainings, you can find them on our website under FREEBIES \ud83d\udc97 \n\nIf you're looking for more support, applications to work with me and build your roadmap to financial success are now open.", "total_engagement": 76, "engagement_rate": 0.0008268688868821603, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-04-05T01:12:59.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "video", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goals", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "figure mentor", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "track", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072006993, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:21.061Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:21.061Z"}, {"id": 607775132072006992, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1594450980", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:21.059Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:21.059Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864879, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:55.732Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:11.958Z"}, {"id": 607775132219864880, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:55.743Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:11.963Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175190289658, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CqqfP6gB2xC/", "post_id": "3074407128682163266", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/89030b8642c4d906780e74649674d1ce.JPEG", "phash": "95406a2b7f95466b", "image_entities": [{"entity": "advertisement", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8152977228164673}, {"entity": "document", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.655216634273529}, {"entity": "brochure", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.39757445454597473}, {"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3663952648639679}, {"entity": "paper", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.361616849899292}, {"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34144163131713867}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.32960543036460876}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9405787587165833}, {"entity": "flyer", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7668977975845337}, {"entity": "menu", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20778314769268036}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-04-07T15:53:50.056Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T02:56:59.228Z"}}], "post_text": "\u201cTHIS is the tough love I needed just to DO THE DAMN THING\u201d. \u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb Fully funded emergency fund\u2060\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb All bills negotiated \u2060\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb 100% debt paid off minus a vehicle & home \u2060\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb refinanced that vehicle from 6.89% to 4.69% &&& $200 less a month\u2060\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb a 2 step CD ladder that will fund my down payment for a new home NEXT YEAR\u2060\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffb Investment accounts set up & running for myself, my husband & 2 kids! \u2060\n\u2060\nIt never ceases to amaze me how much my students move in just a matter of months. \u2060\n\u2060\nThey are living proof that, with the right tools and the knowledge - anything is possible. \u2060\n\u2060\nThere is no such things as a \u201cdream life\u201d anymore - NOW IT\u2019S JUST LIFE \ud83d\ude2d\u2060\nThere is no more \u201cI wish\u201d there is just \u201cI WILL\u201d. \u2060\n\u2060\nYes, money doesn\u2019t buy you happiness.

The sunk cost fallacy - ever heard the saying don't throw good money after bad? we have a tendency to continue on a path simply because we've already invested time and money into it. \n\nBut here's the thing, if what you've been doing isn't working, the time and money you've put into it won't come back no matter how much more you put in. so it's actually better to cut your losses and move on. \n\n2. Your real hourly wage - a lot of us think the number on our paycheck is what we make, but it's not. businesses understand this concept: your income is not your profit, because you had to spend money to earn that income. \n\nAdditionally, you're likely working more hours than you're getting paid for, and this doesn't account for the additional hours you stress and worry about work on your \"you time\". \n\nWhen you actually do the calculation most people find they're making a lot less than they thought. What would it feel like to leave your stressful job and work somewhere that makes you happy (like being a dog walker, or on a lavender farm)? \n\nInvesting can help bridge the income gap to get you to your dream life, instead of staying stuck for decades. \n\nBy learning how money works, many of our students have been able to leave stressful jobs to go find something that better aligns with their life goals (without having to worry about the money). \n\nIf you want something different, check out our link in bio. \n\nWe have 4 free money trainings available, and applications to work with me as

\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 \n\nUsing this strategy I was able to turn a $15k downpayment into $150k profit in 2 years. \n\nAnd then turn that $150k into $500k in another 2 years to build my wealth. \n\nIt is 100% the safest way to invest in real estate. \n\nSo how do you do it? \n\nStep 1: buy a property in a growing area that has \"blemishes\" (aka things you can fix easily). \n\nThe best homes for this strategy are the \"ugly\" homes that need some love, but are still desirable in other ways (aka a good school district, walkable, or transit accessible). \n\nBecause they're ugly, there is likely lower demand (less people interested in the home), which means you may be able to buy it for less (leaving you MORE room to make MORE money). \n\nStep 2: live in the home. Using this strategy with your primary residence (aka the home you live in) can mean a lower downpayment requirement (think 5% or less depending on where you live, versus 20% for a standard investment property - which let's you get in with less). \n\nStep 3: fix the blemishes, update the property, and force appreciation. Appreciation is when the value of the home goes up, meaning the property is worth more than what you bought it for. \n\nYou can sell the home, take your profit and repeat the process, or keep it as a rental. \n\nFollow to learn how to win with money the right way. \n\nPs. we teach you more about building wealth with our free trainings. \n\nIf you like this video I would recommend starting with How

you can get rich too. \n\nThis is a chart showing the changes in price for the S&P500, which is a collection of some of the biggest or best companies in America (500 of them). \n\nIt's a good representation of how the US stock market is doing, so we'll use it for our lesson. \n\nThe absolute best times to buy are when stock prices are lower, ever heard of the saying \"buy low, sell high\"? \n\nSo the best times to buy would have been when stock pirces fell. \n\nBasically while everyone else was scared, those who took action made a lot of money. \n\nBut the thing is, waiting for those times to happen could mean missing out on a ton of money, because although we have a correction (where prices fall) about every 2 years, it's impossible to know exactly when that will be - and the best days can happen around some of the worst, which is why we say you can't time the market, but you can spend time in the market. \n\nSo if you have an opportunity to buy while markets are down, like right now, do it - invest more if you can. \n\nBut keep that same strategy as markets go back up and you'll keep making great money over time. \n\nLearn how to make money while you sleep with our

ever heard of the self-fulfilling prophecy? \n\nIt's the idea that what you believe to be true will become true for you. \n\nAnd when it comes to money, our attitudes and beliefs around money are shaped by the time we're 7 years old. \n\nThat means we use these beliefs to run our lives as adults, and if we never update them, we'll continue to run our lives based on the things we saw and perceived as children. \ud83d\ude33 \n\nThe good news is that the route to getting ahead with money is changing the way you think about yourself and money, and addressing your money mindset. \n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Here are three examples of how this can work: \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 If you believe that you'll never be good with money, you'll likely continue to make choices that confirm that belief. But if you believe that you can learn to be good with money, you'll start to seek out resources and opportunities to improve your financial situation. \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 If you believe that you always have to struggle to make ends meet, you'll likely feel stuck in a cycle of scarcity. But if you believe that abundance is possible, you'll start to see opportunities to create more wealth and prosperity in your life. \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 If you believe that money is the root of all evil, you'll likely avoid money or feel guilty about earning it. But if you believe that money is a tool that can be used for good, you'll start to see ways to use your financial resources to make a positive impact in the world. \n\nAt our free Kick your Shopping Addiction Masterclass, we'll help you start changing the way you spend money so that you can save effortlessly. \n\nIt's time to update your money mindset and start living the life you deserve!

and the things we hear as children can have a significant impact on our financial habits as adults. \n\nFor example, if you grew up hearing phrases like \"money doesn't grow on trees\" or \"we can't afford that,\" you might develop a scarcity mindset, which can lead to overspending. \n\nThis scarcity mindset can make us feel like we need to spend now or else we may never get the chance again. \n\nIt can create a sense of urgency around spending, which can lead to impulse buys and overspending. \n\nIt can also make us feel like we need to keep up with the Joneses, even if we can't afford to do so, because we don't want to feel like we're missing out. \n\nAnother way that childhood experiences can impact our spending habits is through emotional spending. \n\nFor example, if you grew up in a household where gifts and material possessions were used as a way to show love and affection, you might have learned to associate buying things with feeling good. \n\nThis can lead to emotional spending, where we buy things to fill an emotional void or make ourselves feel better. \n\nUnderstanding the psychology and mindset behind overspending is the first step in overcoming it. \n\nBy recognizing the underlying beliefs and emotions that drive our spending habits, we can start to make more conscious choices about how we use our money. \n\nThis is when saving money gets to feel effortless. \n\nAnd that's exactly what our all new FREE \"Kick Your Shopping Addiction\" master class is designed to help you do! \n\nGrab your spot through our website before they fill up! \n\nWe're

tell you the solution to all your money problems is to just create a budget, but the thing is, if it was as easy as writing your expenses down on a piece of paper and getting ahead NO ONE would be struggling. \n\nMost of us know on some level what we\u2019re \u201csupposed to do\u201d - save more, pay off our debt, stop spending on stuff we don\u2019t actually even really like or need. But we\u2019re not doing it. Why? Because the results we get in our life come from our actions, which come from our thoughts and beliefs. \n\nA Budget is an action, and it\u2019s missing the core component that comes before, which is your thoughts and beliefs - or money mindset. \n\nThis is the way you think about money, think about what\u2019s possible for you with money, and think about yourself. Our money mindset includes the beliefs and rules we have about money, and a lot of us have limiting beliefs, aka things we believe that don\u2019t actually serve us and instead limit us in some way. \n\nIf we want a different result, we have to take a different action, and while you may be able to \u201cwill yourself\u201d into a different action in the short term, like using a budget, the reality is that most people won\u2019t have long term success because the driver (their thoughts and beliefs) have remained the same. \n\nExamples of limiting beliefs are: I\u2019m not good with money or I have to work hard to make money. \n\nWhen you tell yourself you\u2019re not good with money, even subconsciously, you will begin to act in the ways someone who wasn\u2019t good with money would act, because it will feel normal to you and will be in alignment with who you think you are. \n\nWhen you tell yourself that you always have to work hard to make money, you\u2019ll avoid strategies like investing because \u201cit seems too easy\u201d. \n\nIn both cases, your beliefs become a self fulfilling prophecy - whatever you believe to be true will be true FOR YOU. For a lot of people, this is the stem of why they\u2019re overspending and still living paycheck to paycheck even though they\u2019re making good money. \n\nThis is the premise of our all new free training Kick Your Shopping Addiction Masterclass. \n\nGrab your spot on our website!", "total_engagement": 184, "engagement_rate": 0.0020018930945568092, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-06T21:55:57.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "experts", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "solution", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "paper", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "piece", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lot", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "results", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "budget", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "actions", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072007522, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:23.300Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:23.300Z"}, {"id": 607775132072007518, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "2071667675", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:23.297Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:23.297Z"}, {"id": 607775132219865013, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:56.339Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:12.409Z"}, {"id": 607775132219865017, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:56.350Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:12.413Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175201288142, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr83KX5g6eW/", "post_id": "3097593249137928086", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/9eea97ddb5979f182933ce88fe1730ac.JPEG", "phash": "875c39147b453769", "image_entities": [{"entity": "cheek", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7475996613502502}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7138416767120361}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7131657004356384}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7059391736984253}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6829422116279602}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5240551233291626}, {"entity": "hairstyle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4056812822818756}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.33821943402290344}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.28472185134887695}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20546036958694458}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6228830814361572}, {"entity": "tie", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2754973769187927}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2411063015460968}, {"entity": "scarf", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23254099488258362}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20703035593032837}, {"entity": "doll", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20658186078071594}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-05-11T06:47:36.084Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T02:59:17.688Z"}}], "post_text": "Confession time: I used to spend a lot of money buying things to project a certain image of myself out into the world. \n\nI wanted to look cool, stylish, and successful, but it was because deep down inside I didn't feel worthy.

\n\nThe answer is simple: because it serves the interests of corporations who want us to keep buying more and more stuff. We're told that shopping is a form of self-care, that we deserve to treat ourselves, and that buying new things will make us happy. \n\nBut in reality, it's just a clever marketing tactic designed to keep lining corporate pockets while we struggle with debt, clutter, and dissatisfaction. \n\nBut here's the good news: you don't have to be a shopaholic. You can break free from this cycle of consumption and find true happiness and fulfillment in life - while still buying things that align with your values and goals. \n\nIt starts by recognizing that you are more than your stuff \u2013 that your worth as a person doesn't depend on the things you own or the brands you wear. \n\nIt's about learning to spend in ways that bring YOU true joy, instead of trying to \"fix the problems\" corporations invent to take your money, and to find healthier ways to deal with stress and emotions. \n\nIf you're ready to kick your shopping addiction for good, I invite you to join my free training program, Kick Your Shopping Addiction Masterclass. \n\nIn this program, you'll learn the secrets to breaking free from impulse shopping and living a more fulfilling life. \n\nClick the link in my bio to sign up now and take the first step towards a happier, healthier you.", "total_engagement": 168, "engagement_rate": 0.001827815434160565, "network_type":

It's all about finding ways to make more money. \n\nExplore opportunities to increase your income so you can invest more and let your money grow for you. \n\nIt could be starting a side hustle, investing in your skills, or seeking promotions and higher-paying jobs. \n\nRemember, the aim is to supercharge your income potential while maintaining a fulfilling life. \n\nSpeaking of investments, here's where the real magic happens. Merely saving money won't cut it. You need to invest your hard-earned funds wisely. By channeling your savings into investment vehicles such as stocks, real estate, or even starting a business, you allow your money to work for you. \n\nSo why is financial freedom worth pursuing with such determination? Let me share the incredible impact it can have on your life. \n\nPicture waking up every morning without the weight of financial stress. You have the freedom to pursue your passions, travel the world, or spend more time with loved ones. It means having choices and the ability to make decisions based on what truly matters to you. Financial freedom grants you peace of mind and the opportunity to create a life that aligns with your dreams and values. \n\nRemember, this path isn't easy, but it's definitely worth it. It requires discipline, resilience, and a long-term perspective. \n\nStart small, set achievable goals, and celebrate every milestone along the way.

\ud83d\ude97\ud83c\udfe0 \n\nWhen we commit to paying too much for these necessities, they can consume a significant portion of our income, leaving little room for flexibility in pursuing other life goals such as investing and saving for the future. \ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcb0 \n\nDid you know that cars, for example, lose an average of 20% of their value in the first year alone? \ud83d\ude31 \n\nMany people fall into the trap of financing high priced vehicles for an extended period, like eight years or more. \n\nAt first, they may manage to make those hefty monthly payments, but in my experience many people will soon realize the financial strain it puts them under. \ud83d\udcb8 \n\nWhat's worse is that when they decide to sell the car because they can't comfortably afford it, they find themselves \"underwater\" on the loan. \ud83c\udf0a But what does that mean? \n\nWell, it means the car's value has depreciated so much that the remaining loan balance exceeds what they could

this huge mistake... \n\nAnd that is increasing their fixed costs, or the things they HAVE to pay for every month, to more than 50% of their income. \n\nThe biggest offenders in this category are houses and cars. So many people have increased their costs to the point where they don't have any money for fun, or travel, or they're having to work so much to pay for those fixed costs that they don't have any time to enjoy with their friends or family. \n\nNow I don't typically like arbitrary numbers like this, because everyone's situation is different, but there's a caveat. And that is you need to understand the tradeoff costs and opportunity costs, basically all the things that you're giving up or trading. \n\nI had a student who loved living downtown, it made her so happy, but it ate up 50% of her income. \n\nDoes this mean she can't do it? No, because she didn't have kids and wasn't planning on having them, so she didn't have daycare costs. She walked to work so she didn't own a car, so no car payment, maintenance, insurance, gas etc. She loved cooking at home and didn't go out to eat much. So she was able to save big money in other areas to make up for it. \n\nShe decided that living downtown was more important to her than those other things, and she allocated her income appropriately. \n\nWhat many people do is increase their housing or car costs, while maintaining the same level of spending in other areas thinking its bringing them happiness - when the reality is its just bringing them stress and sadness because they aren't able to hit other financial and life goals, like going to their best friends wedding, traveling, or saving for retirement. \n\nIf you're stuck feeling like you're having a hard time saying no to yourself when it comes to spending money, then you need to sign up for our all new free Kick Your Shopping Addiction Masterclass. \n\nIt's going to change your life.

\n\nSometimes our spending habits can be shaped by the experiences we had growing up, even if they were well-intentioned. \n\nIf you grew up in a household where your parents were very frugal and penny-pinching, and said things like \"we don't have the money for that,\" it might be impacting your spending psychology today. \n\nWhen we grow up with this kind of mindset, it can create a sense of deprivation and lack in our lives. We may feel like we missed out on things that we really wanted, and now we're overcompensating by spending more than we should. \n\nHere are a few examples of how this can show up in our spending habits: \n\nSplurging on luxuries: When we grow up in a household that is very frugal, we may have been conditioned to see anything beyond the essentials as a luxury. As a result, we might overspend on things that we perceive as \"treats,\" like fancy dinners or designer clothes, even if we can't afford them. \n\nBuying things to fill a void: If we grew up feeling like we didn't have enough, we might develop a scarcity mindset that makes us feel like we need to constantly acquire more things.

Thinking your Roth IRA is an investment, it's not. If you just transferred money into your account but didn't actually buy investments, you're just losing money not making it. \n\n2. Investing only in your 401k or employer RRSP. The fees are high, and your investment options are limited. Contribute to get the employer match and then invest on your own, you'll make more. \n\n3. Asking your employer to hold back more money for taxes so you get a refund, you're giving the government an interest free loan with money that could have been working for you and making you MORE money throughout the year. \n\n4. You don't need to know \"what the best stocks are\" because studies show stock pickers lose money. Buy the entire market, and then let your money do the work. Choosing your investments is the easiest part. \n\n5. Choosing your investment account without considering your income level, if you're making under $50k a year you probably shouldn't be using an RRSP or traditional IRA. \n\n6. Taking advice from people who don't have the life you want. Sara from work thinks investing is gambling, has never been educated about how to invest, has none of her own, and doesn't think she'll ever be able to stop working?

Well, studies have shown that people who invest solely in individual stocks tend to make less money and take on substantial risks. \n\nIt's great to make money, but it's equally important not to lose it.

They offer a balanced mix of assets that help lower risk and make you more money. \ud83d\udcc8 \n\nTo help you kick-start your investment journey, I have a special gift for you.

Sure. \n\nThe same way you could crash your car if you went out for a joyride before you had your license. \n\nNot learning how to do the thing you're trying to do before you do it is a surefire way to set yourself up for failure. It is possible to reduce your investing risk to 0 by diversifying (meaning not putting all your eggs in one basket - or not betting your money on a single company, country, or industry). \n\nYou also need to be diversifying over time. A Vanguard study showed that with a properly diversified portfolio your risk of losing money after 20 years drops to 0. Meaning there has never been a 20 year period where the total stock market produced a negative return. \n\nThis is all publicly available data. Stock prices will always go up and down in the short term, and it's possible individual stocks or companies go to 0 and stay there - that's why you invest long term and diversify. \n\nThis is also why you need to learn how to invest properly before you start (YES even if you work with a financial advisor). \n\nThere are a lot of myths perpetuated by people who 1. don't know how to invest 2. have \"invested\" before and lost money because they didn't do it properly and 3.by institutions who want you to pay them exorbitant fees by pretending \"it's hard\". \n\nIt's not hard, if you can learn to drive a car you can learn to invest. \n\nStart learning the right way to make money investing with our free investing masterclass. \n\nGrab your spot on our website under FREEBIES \u2764\ufe0f", "total_engagement": 151, "engagement_rate": 0.0016428579199895554, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-05-26T15:56:16.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "risk", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "failure", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "data", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "car", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072008047, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:24.939Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:24.939Z"}, {"id": 607775132072008046, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1180867762", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:24.937Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:24.937Z"}, {"id": 607775132219865125, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:56.770Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:12.708Z"}, {"id": 607775132219865129, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:56.779Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:12.715Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175210848118, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Csv7riEMydR/", "post_id": "3111968343795640145", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/80f390a760d4534927fb13f5593540ba.JPEG", "phash": "afc29605dc4909fe", "image_entities": [{"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6604447960853577}, {"entity": "t-shirt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6576235890388489}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.637482762336731}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.46450719237327576}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4607568681240082}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3985113799571991}, {"entity": "hairstyle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3784315884113312}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2667522728443146}, {"entity": "shoulder", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2160140872001648}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9389162063598633}, {"entity": "blouse", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6439161896705627}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4268127977848053}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4104667901992798}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.34197089076042175}, {"entity": "pants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22237803041934967}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-05-31T21:41:11.865Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T03:00:50.464Z"}}], "post_text": "GET PAID LIKE A BUSINESS OWNER WITHOUT ALL THE WORK \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 \n\nEver thought about starting a business to make more money, but don't have the time or energy to start one? \ud83d\udcb0 \n\nWell, guess what?

Here's why: \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Lack of Global Exposure: The S&P 500 is primarily focused on the largest publicly traded U.S. companies, which means it overlooks opportunities outside the United States. A truly diversified portfolio should consider international markets, providing exposure to different regions and industries. \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Sector Concentration: The S&P 500 is market-cap-weighted, meaning larger companies have a more significant influence. Consequently, certain sectors, such as technology or finance, may dominate the index. Overreliance on a specific sector increases vulnerability to sector-specific risks and potential downturns. \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Omission of Small Caps: The S&P 500 primarily includes large-cap stocks, neglecting the smaller companies. Small-cap stocks can offer unique growth opportunities and help diversify risk by tapping into different market segments. \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Non-Inclusion of Other Asset Classes: The S&P 500 focuses solely on stocks, overlooking other asset classes like bonds, real estate, commodities, and alternative investments. Including a variety of assets can help mitigate risk and improve the overall stability of your portfolio. \n\nA special shout out to the poppler fluff in my hair making its debut appearance. \n\nWant to keep learning?

We all have aspirations. \n\nWe say we want to make more money, strive to be rich, but have you ever stopped to ask yourself, \"What does it actually do for my life?\" \ud83e\udd14 \n\nPersonally, I can tell you that motivation alone didn't make me a millionaire. If I had solely relied on it, I probably wouldn't be where I am today. The key lies in having a burning desire and a relentless pursuit of your goals. \n\nLet me share my thoughts on this. \ud83d\udcaa Every action I take, every decision I make is driven by two crucial factors: my \"Why\" and my goals. \ud83c\udfaf \n\nLet's dive into it! Let's say your goal is to be rich. \n\nNow, ask yourself why. Why do you want to be rich? Dig deep and keep asking why. \n\nFor example: \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Why do I want to be rich? Well, because I want financial freedom and security. \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Why is financial freedom important to me? Because it allows me to have more time for my family and pursue my passions. \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Why is having more time for family and passions significant? Because it brings me fulfillment and happiness. \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Why does fulfillment and happiness matter? Because I believe that a meaningful life is built on these foundations. \n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Why is a meaningful life my ultimate goal? Because deep down, I want to leave a positive impact on the world and create a legacy for future generations. \n\nBy continually questioning your motives and diving deeper into your \"Why,\" you unveil the true driving force behind your goals. \ud83d\udca1 \n\nThis understanding becomes your guiding light, pushing you forward when motivation wanes. In those moments when you're not feeling motivated, it's your determination that will push you to get up and do what needs to be done. \ud83d\udca5 \n\nRemember, motivation is fleeting, but your \"Why\" is the rock-solid foundation that will keep you going even through challenging times. \n\nSo, Babes, don't just rely on motivation. Embrace a relentless pursuit of your goals, fueled by a clear understanding of your \"Why.\" \ud83c\udf1f \n\nLet your \"Why\" be your superpower and the driving force that leads you to your dream life. \n\nWhat is your real \"why\"?

\n\nI'm talking about mutual funds, whole life insurance, and a financial advisor who charges a fee that's a percentage of your portfolio. \n\n(this is called a MER or management expense ratio). \n\nThese fees are so insidious because they may seem small (2-3%), but they can add up to costing tens to hundreds of thousands (even +$1M) over your lifetime. \n\nI made this video after receiving a DM from a follower who could just not believe that she would pay $1M to her financial advisor for a couple hours of work over her lifetime (for something she could have easily done herself). \n\nI can think of a lot of things I'd rather do with a million dollars (like retire early, or spend more on things I love - not lining some corporations pockets with cash).\n\n Same goes for things like high priced mutual funds these advisors push because that's where they make the most money - they're designed to make banks rich, not you. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on products like whole life insurance, that are pushed so hard because the commission on them can be your entire first year of premiums. \n\nYes.

\ud83d\udcbc\u2728 Look no further than Target Date Funds! \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udcc8 \n\nLet's break it down: \n\nTarget Date Fund: A target date fund is an investment that automatically adjusts its asset allocation based on your projected retirement date. It's designed to be a set-it-and-forget-it approach, making it perfect for those who want a hassle-free investing experience. \n\nTicker Symbol: Ticker symbols are short form names for investments. This is what you would use to search the investment when you want to buy it at your brokerage. \n\nWhen investing in a target date fund, it's essential to do your research outside of your brokerage app to find the appropriate fund for your retirement goals. \n\nHow does a Target Date Fund work? \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udcbc A target date fund is designed to automatically adjust its asset allocation (how many stocks versus bonds you own) as you approach your retirement date. \n\nWhen you're young, the fund will generally have a higher allocation towards stocks, which tend to have higher potential returns but also higher volatility (you'll see the prices go up and down more in the short term). \n\nAs you get closer to retirement, the fund will gradually shift its allocation towards more conservative investments like bonds. This strategy is designed to reduce risk as you approach your target retirement date. \n\nThe beauty of a target date fund lies in its simplicity. By investing in one, you can just set it and forget it. \n\nThe fund will make adjustments over time, rebalancing the portfolio to maintain an appropriate risk level. \n\n\u2b50 ready to learn how to make free money investing?

Money is a tool, and our goal should be to use it wisely to create the life we want. It's all about finding that balance between saving for our goals and deriving happiness from the dollars we spend. \n\nIf we grew up in a scarcity, we're often taught to be cautious and save every dollar, which may seem great - but can actually hold you back from the most important part of money.... enjoying it. \n\nSo, what should you do instead? \n\n\ud83d\udcdd Reverse engineer your goals! Set specific targets for what you need to save to achieve those dreams, whether it's a down payment on a home, starting a business, or traveling the world. Having a clear financial target keeps us focused and motivated. \ud83d\udcaa \n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Now, imagine you get a raise or a bonus. Take a moment to celebrate your hard work and the progress you've made! And guess what? You're allowed to spend some of that extra money on things that bring you joy. Treat yourself! Enjoy a nice dinner, go on that adventure you've been eyeing, or invest in personal growth. Happiness and balance matters, too! \ud83d\ude04 \n\n\u23e9 If you're looking to speed up your timeline to your goals, you can absolutely do that. But remember, it's not about accumulating money just for the sake of it. It's about optimizing our spending to maximize happiness and align it with our values. Invest in experiences, relationships, and personal development, as these are often the sources of true fulfillment. \ud83c\udf08 \n\n\ud83d\udca1 So, let's break free from the scarcity mindset and embrace a balanced approach. \n\nSave for your dreams, invest in yourself, and remember that money is a tool to create a life of joy and fulfillment. Use it wisely and derive the most happiness possible from every dollar spent. \ud83d\udcab", "total_engagement": 223, "engagement_rate": 0.002426207391772655, "network_type": "instagram",

That brings happiness. Winning with money and building a fat bank account isn't about the money itself, but rather, what the money can do for your life. It's about the incredible opportunities and peace of mind that come along with financial stability. Let me share with you the real value of money and how it has transformed my life. \n\nMoney is a tool, a means to an end. Its purpose is to help us derive the most happiness from every dollar spent. For me, money has provided so much more than material possessions. It has allowed me to experience true freedom and live a life free from financial worries. Gone are the days of sleepless nights and constant stress. With financial stability, I can rest easy, knowing that my needs are met, and I have a solid foundation for the future. I am grateful and happy for my friends who are also winning, instead of feeling envious or jealous. \n\nTogether, we celebrate our successes and support one another on our journeys. One of the greatest joys money has brought me is the ability to travel and explore the world. \n\nI can book trips without hesitation, knowing that I won't be burdened by debt or financial constraints. The freedom to experience new cultures, make unforgettable memories, and broaden my horizons is priceless. Moreover, financial stability has empowered me to align my daily habits with my core values. \n\nFamily and freedom are my guiding principles, and money has provided me with the means to work towards my goals. I can prioritize spending quality time with my loved ones while pursuing my passions and dreams. \n\nAs I share my journey, I want to emphasize that money should never be the sole focus. It's not about accumulating wealth for the sake of it; it's about harnessing the power of money to create a life that brings true happiness and fulfillment. \n\nI want this for you. \n\nStart learning with our free trainings, or apply to work with me.

I'd always live paycheck to paycheck, and people that had \"nice things\" or financial stability were just lucky.\n\nBut after hitting my rock bottom I realized that I wanted more from life.\n\nI wanted freedom and safety and security.\n\nI didn't want to trade the best years of my life for money.\n\nI didn't want to miss out on memories with my kids.\n\nI didn't want to go to sleep every night worrying about what bills were coming out and where the money was going to come from.\n\nAnd even after I did \"what you're supposed to do\" ie. go to school and get the good job, I still felt stuck.\n\nWhen I decided to learn how money works that's when everything changed.\n\nI was able to save my first $100k by 25.\n\nI bought my dream home.\n\nPaid for my wedding in cash.\n\nPaid off my $40k student loans in 18 months.\n\nStarted investing and became a millionaire at 30.\n\nNow I've set my children up to become millionaires in their lifetime, too.\n\nMy kids will never have to worry about money, and they'll have a completely different life experience than I did.\n\nAnd the craziest thing, this wealth I've created won't only change their lives for the better, but the ones who come after them too.\n\nI'm the point in my lineage where everything changed. Me. I did this.\n\nAnd it's such a crazy feeling that I don't even quite know how to put into words.\n\nKnowing that because of the choices I've made, the path for my entire lineage has changed.\n\nAnd whoosh, this shit is powerful.\n\nI can't wait to help you build your dream life and become ground 0, too.\n\nCheck out our website to get started learning.

It's time to embrace our independence and become our own rich man. \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 No more reliance on others: One of the most liberating aspects of being your own rich man is that you no longer have to rely on anyone else for financial stability. You can pave your own path, set your own goals, and work towards achieving them on your terms. Being financially independent gives you the freedom to make choices that align with your values and aspirations, without the need for approval or support from others. \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 No permission needed: As an independent woman, you have the power to make decisions without seeking permission. Whether it's pursuing your dream career, starting your own business, or investing in your passions, you are in control. Being your own boss means you can follow your intuition, take risks, and chart your own course. You don't have to wait for someone else's approval or validation because you know your worth and have the ability to carve out your own success. \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 In charge of your life and future: Building your own wealth and success gives you a sense of empowerment like no other. You have the autonomy to shape your life and future according to your own vision. You can create financial security, invest in personal growth, and make choices that align with your priorities. Being your own rich man means having the power to create a life that is not limited by societal expectations. \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Freedom to leave bad situations: One of the most significant advantages of being your own rich man is the ability to walk away from toxic environments, be it a job or a relationship.

\ud83d\udeab \n\n\ud83d\udcdd Have you ever wondered why some organizations are so eager to force employees back to the office? It's not because they believe it will magically increase productivity, but rather because they crave control. \n\nLet's unpack this: \n\n\u2716\ufe0f The people who aren't working from home aren't the same ones who magically become super productive in the office. They're the individuals you find hanging out in the coffee room or engaged in long conversations at their desks. Whether they have someone watching them or not, their lack of productivity persists. \n\n\ud83d\udcbc When I worked in my corporate job, I was driven by the desire to make a difference and streamline processes for the better. However, my efforts were met with indifference. The system was resistant to change because it preferred sticking to the traditional ways of doing things. Efficiency and innovation took a backseat to the status quo. \n\n\ud83d\udd04 If it truly were about productivity, organizations would conduct thorough process audits and actively seek ways to leverage technology for improvement. They would embrace change and explore avenues to make tasks easier, faster, and more efficient. But sadly, that's not what we see. They cling to outdated practices simply because \"that's the way it's always been done.\" \n\n\u26a1\ufe0f So let's call it what it really is: an attempt to maintain control. The office becomes a symbol of surveillance, a means to keep employees in check rather than empowering them to excel. \n\nThe focus shifts from achieving remarkable results to ensuring people adhere to an antiquated notion of work.", "total_engagement": 609, "engagement_rate": 0.006625830948832048, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-07-02T14:50:30.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "system", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "office", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "productivity", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ones", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "control", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "attempt", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "individuals", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "employees", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "organizations", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072009049, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:28.466Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:28.466Z"}, {"id": 607775132072009046, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1261120928", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:28.463Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:28.463Z"}, {"id": 607775132219865349, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:57.682Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:13.482Z"}, {"id": 607775132219865352, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:57.689Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:13.487Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175223794112, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CuPbFTzp1w8/", "post_id": "3138846577421409340", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/f2ca69b321cc7ea937209ff258aff26e.JPEG", "phash": "d588e2d39a388c7e", "image_entities": [{"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8097243905067444}, {"entity": "blouse", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7686886191368103}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7236584424972534}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6182265877723694}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5825262069702148}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5051044821739197}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2816934585571289}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-07-16T04:14:39.689Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T03:03:39.235Z"}}], "post_text": "Did you know that the cost to attend a university has skyrocketed nearly eight times faster than our wages did? \ud83d\ude31 \n\nBetween 1989 and 2016, the cost of a four-year degree exploded to a staggering $104,480, while real median wages only increased from $54,042 to $59,039.

We were told that going to school was the key to success, but now we find ourselves feeling like we're drowning in debt. I want to extend my empathy to those who thought their loans would be forgiven by the Biden Administration. I honestly never believed it would go all the way through, but it sucks, plain and simple. \n\nThe reason it was blocked in the Supreme Court was due to Biden v. Nebraska, where the president's plan was challenged by six Republican-led states. They argued that debt relief would hurt their states' tax revenues (THEY'LL ALWAYS GET THAT TAX MONEY) and MOHELA, a student-loan company based in Missouri, who didn't even know they were being named in the lawsuit. \ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f\ud83d\udcbc \n\nBut let's not lose hope! Now that student loan payments will resume, I want to share three important steps we can take: \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 First, I know it's tough, but we have to face our loan balances head-on. Understanding the interest rates and minimum payments is crucial to managing our debt effectively. Log into your accounts, check your balances, minimum payments, and who you owe what to. \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 If you've been setting aside your student loan payments while they were paused into a HYSA (this was my recommendation), now you have a lump sum to put against those loans. \n\nYou can actually call and request that it be directly applied to the loan principle! \ud83c\udfe6\ud83d\udcde \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Lastly, let's invest in our financial knowledge. The more we know about managing money, the better equipped we are to make more, save more, pay off those loans faster, and start building our wealth through smart investments. \n\nEducation is not just about degrees; it's about empowering ourselves financially. \n\nStart learning how to win with money with our free trainings.

Imagine someone who is broke \u2013 maybe they're constantly experiencing lifestyle inflation or lifestyle creep whenever they get a pay increase. Their fixed expenses are so high that they're unable to save money. \n\nBut here's the thing: by addressing these expenses, changing their money mindset and making conscious choices, they can change their situation in the future. It's about being aware and taking control of our financial decisions. \ud83d\udcca \n\nAnother example are those who make good money but struggle to save due to impulse shopping and poor money management. Trust me, I've been there too! The good news is that by increasing your financial literacy and changing your money mindset, you can transform your situation. It's about seeing money for what it truly is and making intentional choices. \ud83d\udca1\n\nBut what about those who are living in poverty? It's important to understand that it doesn't mean it's impossible to change your situation, but it is undeniably more challenging when there are external factors holding you back. That's why it's crucial to recognize that everyone's journey is different, and empathy is key. \ud83e\udd1d \n\nThe strategies someone uses to escape poverty versus being broke are going to be different. \n\nIf you're broke, don't stress. Trust me, I've been there too, and I know how tough it can be. But here's the silver lining: we can help each other rise above. \n\nWe've supported thousands of students facing similar challenges by empowering them through financial literacy and teaching them how to make more money through negotiation, money management strategies, and investing. \ud83c\udf1f", "total_engagement": 118, "engagement_rate": 0.0012838227454223016, "network_type": "instagram",

investment? \n\nNo, real estate is where I built the majority of my wealth in my 20s, it was the foundation to me hitting millionaire status at 30. \n\nBut I've made a few posts lately talking about some of the risks that come with investing in real estate, showing people that contrary to popular belief, yes you can lose money in real estate, and many people do. \n\nThe same way I educate you guys on ways people lose money in the stock market (by doing things like day trading, catching fomo, and letting emotions take over), and help you avoid money traps like forex and crypto, is the same way that I educate people on real estate. \n\nI was a top broker for 6 years, I've worked on hundreds of deals, and I have seen first hand how people get swept up in cognitive bias that says \"I'm better than everyone else so even though this is risky I'll be fine\" and societal beliefs like \"real estate never loses money\", and I've seen how hard it can rock someone financially. \n\nThis can be an even larger loss than the stock market, because you're not just using your own money to invest - you're using the banks money. \n\nLeverage, aka a loan, can be a great way to increase your

You can do this by taking a course to increase your skillset, or by learning the skill of negotiation so you start getting paid your worth - when you learn how to effectively negotiate, you can get offers 10%, 20% or even 30% higher than what you're currently getting paid. \n\nThe next step is to open the right accounts to funnel your money into. You want a checking account in your name only, keep a maximum of 6 weeks of expenses there. \n\nThen you'll want a high yield savings account that is NOT attached to your checking account. You're going to use this for your emergency fund, work that up to 6-12 months of bare bones expenses. It may take a little while to get there, so set the goal of first saving $1,000, then 3 months, then 6 months etc to help keep you motivated along the way.\n\n Then you're going to open up an account to start investing for your future. I know you may be tempted to start saving for your kids, but you need to put your mask on first. The best gift you can give your kids is a financially stable parent, so get your ducks in order then we can start setting them up - they can finance their college degree, you can't finance your retirement. \n\nYou're going to open something like a Roth IRA in the US or TFSA in Canada, and set up automatic contributions everytime you get paid. Even if it's just $50 a month right now, the important part is to get started and then increase when you can.\n\n Lastly I'll say, give yourself grace.

If you follow the traditional path, you'll always live paycheck to paycheck because you're always selling your time in the future, then working trying to catch back up. \n\nThe key here is learning how to trade places with your money, so instead of you going to work to make a paycheck, your money works so you get paid while you live your life. \n\nUnderstanding this helped me create a 6 figure salary for myself that I don't have to work for. \n\nAnd this is what the rich do, they know they'll never get ahead if they're always trading time for money. Instead of selling their time in the future, they buy their life back through investing. I'm here to help you change your life. \n\nStart learning with our free training: Investing Masterclass.

Leverage is about achieving the biggest result with the least amount of effort. \n\nBusiness owners use leverage when they hire employees, so they can produce bigger results and make more money. When business owners borrow money to grow their company, it's leverage. They're making more money off of other people's money. \n\nYou can use these strategies in your own life, this is how I became a millionaire. \n\n1. instead of always looking for ways to further employ yourself, like working overtime or a side hustle, because your time is a limited resource, look for ways to get something working for you - like your money. \n\nPutting your money into the stock market can make you a millionaire while you sleep. \n\n2. You can make money off other people's money by using leverage to buy real estate and cash flowing properties. Think of this: invest $50k into the stock market, make 10%, you've made $5k. Invest $50k into a $500k house, and it goes up by 10%, you've just made $50k. \n\nYou've actually made a 100% return on your investment because you're using other people's money to get paid. \n\nStart learning with our free trainings.

When a new young investor comes in who doesn't know how the market works, it's easiest for them to recommend \"low risk\" mutual funds - but you're the only person who doesn't win.

It makes it easy for corporations to exploit us, because we think \"this is just how it has to be\".\n\nWhen you're complacent, you keep doing what you're doing - but when you get curious, that's when everything changes.\n\nInstead of looking at people who have the things you want, like the nice houses, the clothes, the vacations, as the exception or outlier, look at them as the rule for what's possible - because if it's been done that means it IS possible, you just need to figure out the right strategy for your situation.\n\n80% of millionaires are first generation wealth builders.\n\nStep 2: The power of yet\n\nYou may say to yourself:\n\nI'm not rich \nI can't travel \nI can't buy that house\n\nBut this is a fixed mindset - where you believe you're limited by your situation. Studies show that people with a fixed mindset stay in situations they're unhappy with, not because they can't change them, but because they believe they can't so they never take action.\n\nInstead, add the power of yet to your negative statements:\n\nI'm not rich... yet\nI can't travel... yet \nI can't buy that house... yet\n\nBy incorporating the power of yet you'll prime your brain to look for opportunity. \n\n3. Stop trying to work harder \n\nThe rich don't work harder, they work smarter, and if you want to be rich you need to do what they do.\n\nI used to think to make more money I needed more jobs, but what I didn't understand then was the power of leverage.\n\nLeverage is when you use something small to get a big result.\n\nThis concept I applied to investing.\n\nI turned $15k into $150k, and then turned that into over $500k in real estate. I kept investing and working smarter, by using things like stocks, real estate, REITs and MICs, and that's how I became a millionaire at 30.\n\nStart learning with our free trainings!", "total_engagement": 327, "engagement_rate": 0.003557712184348242, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-07-21T17:33:33.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "family", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lot", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mindset", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "wealth", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lie", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "millionaire", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072009565, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:30.522Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:30.522Z"}, {"id": 607775132072009564, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-305752864", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:30.519Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:30.519Z"}, {"id": 607775132219865462, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:58.278Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:13.973Z"}, {"id": 607775132219865463, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:58.288Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:13.979Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175229058990, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CvAnhLBJM03/", "post_id": "3152693542546361655", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/1f3cf24ef918a85729c62d13f8a2875b.JPEG", "phash": "b9c6822d96fde00b", "image_entities": [{"entity": "cool", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7485197186470032}, {"entity": "belt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6999149322509766}, {"entity": "car seat", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6143224835395813}, {"entity": "cushion", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5485904216766357}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.48453694581985474}, {"entity": "driving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.45042872428894043}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.43386176228523254}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34981825947761536}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.33734866976737976}, {"entity": "headrest", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2767447829246521}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.25181734561920166}, {"entity": "vehicle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21237812936306}, {"entity": "baseball cap", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8609978556632996}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5971951484680176}, {"entity": "helmet", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.45628678798675537}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.397998183965683}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3764480948448181}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.27068352699279785}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2368563562631607}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-07-28T20:58:59.450Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T06:11:39.956Z"}}], "post_text": "WHY MY BUDGET KEPT ME BROKE \n\nI used to think that budgeting would be the ultimate solution to my financial struggles, so I tried the envelope method to manage my money. But to my surprise, all it did was reinforce a scarcity and fixed mindset - which kept me stuck and stressed. \ud83d\ude13 \n\nLet me explain why. When I couldn't stick to my budget, I felt like I was constantly failing. It made me believe that I was just bad with money, and that fixed mindset became a barrier to my financial growth. \ud83d\udea7 No matter how diligently I tracked my expenses on spreadsheets, the underlying behaviors that kept me stuck remained unaddressed. \n\nThat's because writing your expenses down does nothing to change the patterns that got you where you are. It doesn't help you make more money, or grow your wealth. Most of us ~know ~ on some level what we need to do: pay off debt, save more, or start investing... but we're not. A budget doesn't address the reasons WHY we're not, it's nothing more than a bandaid approach. \n\nHere's the hard truth: a whopping 79% of people who attempt budgeting end up feeling just like I did - defeated and broke. \ud83d\udc94 Those feelings of scarcity and a fixed mindset never helped me build wealth or achieve financial success. But the turning point came when I decided to take a different approach, and it changed everything for me! \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Instead of focusing on budgets, I tackled the underlying psychological factors that were holding me back. It was about understanding my money beliefs and behaviors, which led me to a new methodology. I learned skills to make and save more, like negotiation, and started investing those savings to grow my wealth.\n\n And guess what? This new approach not only helped me save my first $100,000 by 25, but it also allowed me to pay for my dream wedding and home in cash! \ud83c\udf89 And the best part?

Simple interest is straightforward. You earn interest on the initial amount you invested, and that's it. It's like getting paid for having money sit around, but it won't make your jaw drop.\n\nBut compound interest, well, it's where the real magic happens! \ud83d\udd2e With compound interest, you not only earn interest on your initial investment, but you also earn interest on the interest you've already earned. It's a beautiful snowball effect that can turn those tiny contributions into a fortune over time.\n\nLet me break it down with an example of what I'm doing for my kids. I've set up an investment account for them, and starting from the moment they were born, I've been putting aside $200 a month for them.  It took 5 minutes for me to set this up.\n\nI'll keep this up until they turn 20, and with compound interest doing its thing, that account could grow into a massive $10 million by the time they're ready to retire! \ud83d\ude32 \n\nBut wait, there's more! Even if they never put a dollar of their own into it after that, they could even retire early with an annual income of over $60,000, thanks to compound interest continuing to work its magic.\n\nIt's like setting them up for financial freedom from day one! \ud83d\udcb8 And the best part is, this isn't some secret formula only a select few know about. You can totally apply this concept to yourself by learning more about compound interest and making it work for you.\n\nThat's why I'm so excited to share these free trainings we have on our website (under freebies). Trust me, once you grasp the power of compound interest, you'll see how it can make you rich too!\n\n\ud83d\ude80 It's time to turn those small amounts of money into BIG amounts over time, and secure the financial freedom we all deserve!

\ud83d\udc83 \n\nLess Debt, Better Management: Women carry less debt compared to men, with slightly lower credit card balances, personal debt, and car loans. Their responsible debt management is a testament to their financial acumen, and they even boast slightly higher credit scores. \n\nSavers by Nature: A Fidelity Study found that women save a higher percentage of their income into retirement accounts and are proactive in adding more to their investment accounts outside of work. \n\nMindful Spending: Despite earning an average of $10,000 less per year than men, women spend less money. Their price-conscious approach and savvy shopping skills help them make every penny count. \n\nGenerosity and Prosperity: Women demonstrate incredible generosity, with 93% of high-net-worth women giving to charity compared to 87% of men. This philanthropic spirit precedes prosperity and empowers both the giver and the receiver. \n\nSmart Investors: Contrary to popular belief, women achieve better investment returns than men, according to a Fidelity study. Their patience, well-thought decisions, and lower risk-taking contribute to this financial success. \n\nThe Power of Patience: Women display more patience as investors, avoiding the overconfidence trap that men often fall into.

That's because investing is quite literally how you turn small amounts of money into big amounts of money over time, and that's because you don't get simple interest when you invest, you get compound interest. \n\nSimple interest is calculated only on the initial amount. So if you saved $1,000 you'd get interest only on that $1,000. \n\nCompound interest is when your free money earns you more money, and this is how you're going to get rich. See if you had $1,000 earning compound interest, let's say earning the average return of the stock market, 10%, you'd have $1100 the first year. \n\nBut the second year you wouldn't just earn that 10% on the $1000, you'd earn it on the free money too. The magic really starts to happen over time, because as each year passes you make more free money, then you have more money to make you free money, and it becomes this snowball effect. \n\nYour account just keeps growing bigger and bigger, making you richer without working harder. \n\nSo let's say Mary starts saving $300 a month into her 401k, and her company has a dollar for dollar match, meaning she's contributing a total of $600 a month to her 401k. \n\nPs if you have a 401k with employer matching and you're not using it you're giving away free money, you're literally doubling your money instantly, that's a 100% return on your investment that would take 7-10 years in the stock market to get. \n\nBut I digress. If she was investing $600 a month from 25, she could retire early at 55 a millionaire. \n\nShe would have only contributed about $100k of her own money, the rest of this $1.2M was free money because she knew how to put it in the right places. \n\nKeep learning about money and build a fat bank account with our free trainings!

\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 \n\nLet's chat about the differences between equal (50/50) and equitable when it comes to household responsibilities. \n\nIt's important to remember that achieving financial fairness is more than just splitting bills. It's about security, teamwork, and a willingness to share. \ud83d\udc91\ud83d\udcac\u2063 \n\nHere's the scoop: Equality means treating everyone the same, while equity ensures everyone has the chance for similar outcomes. \ud83d\udcca\ud83d\udca1 Studies suggest that equity tends to be the fairer outcome, as it considers different starting points and circumstances.\u2063 \n\nSo how does financial equity look in relationships? It involves adjusting expenses based on each person's income, valuing unpaid labor, and ensuring both partners have a say in money matters without guilt or allowances. \ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\udc95\u2063 \n\nWhy does this matter? Well, outside of relationships, we can see the effects of inequity, like the gender pay gap. It's essential to achieve financial fairness to avoid negative impacts like financial stress and lower quality of life.\u2063 \n\nWhen there's an earning disparity, equity becomes even more crucial. Women, in particular, can be disadvantaged if financial equity isn't achieved, facing potential challenges in retirement and beyond (due to circumstances like the motherhood penalty). \n\nIf you're working towards financial equity, start by having open conversations as a team, understanding each other's values, and setting joint goals. \n\nRemember, there's no one-size-fits-all approach, but understanding the difference between equal and equitable can help you create a stronger financial foundation for your relationship. \n\nThe goal is to thrive, not just survive. \n\nI teach you how to win with money \ud83d\udcb0 get started with our free trainings. \n\nFind them on our website under FREEBIES \ud83e\udd0d", "total_engagement": 554, "engagement_rate": 0.006027438991219958, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-07-29T15:30:22.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "everyone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bills", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "scoop", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "labor", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "outcome", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "chance", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "differences", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "security", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "relationships", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132072009728, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:31.239Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:31.239Z"}, {"id": 607775132072009726, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1095783623", "created_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:31.236Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-04T07:38:31.236Z"}, {"id": 607775132219865504, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:58.529Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.179Z"}, {"id": 607775132219865505, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-23T17:38:58.540Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.183Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175233167010, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CvU5pYEMzPb/", "post_id": "3158402770683507675", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/c2de395e5b4ea65709efd66e40ff206c.JPEG", "phash": "903193353f34273f", "image_entities": [{"entity": "belt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7333486080169678}, {"entity": "beauty", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6938751339912415}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5086291432380676}, {"entity": "driving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.49632570147514343}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.49462905526161194}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4858151972293854}, {"entity": "headrest", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.462430477142334}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4038405120372772}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.35320138931274414}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.31133830547332764}, {"entity": "vehicle door", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3034542202949524}, {"entity": "seat belt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2664255201816559}, {"entity": "vehicle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20500321686267853}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.873600959777832}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.42822131514549255}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.291262686252594}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-08-04T08:16:21.337Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T06:12:18.898Z"}}], "post_text": "If you want to get rich AF in your 30s starting from nothing then listen up -

A person with a broke mindset will never be rich. \n\nA wealth mindset on the other hand sees them having $0 today as a starting point, not the end. It looks for ways how they can, instead of how they can't. \n\nA wealth mindset focuses on earning more, while a broke mindset focuses only on saving. \n\nRemember: there will always be a limit to what you can cut out of your life, but there's never a limit to what you can earn. \n\nA broke mindset only thinks about ways to turn their labor into money, but a wealth mindset thinks about ways to turn their money into little workers, so they no longer have to work to get paid. \n\nA wealth mindset thinks about investing to buy their time, while a broke mindset sees buying assets like stocks as an expense or sacrifice. \n\nA wealth mindset pays themselves first so they can give future them the life they wish they had today, a broke mindset pays themselves last - pretending that they still won't be them in the future. \n\nA wealth mindset embraces any type of education that can make them more money, whereas a broke mindset only thinks about university degrees - that's why they'll always keep trading hours for dollars. \n\nWhether you think you can, or you think you can't, you're right.

It's the freedom to do the things you've always wanted without worrying about having the time or money to do them. \ud83d\ude4c\u2728\u2063 \n\nSo, how can we calculate our financial freedom using the 4% rule? Most financial experts say we need about 70 to 80% of our pre-retirement income in retirement. To find out how much we'd need in traditional stock market investments to be financially free, we take our desired annual income and multiply it by 25. \ud83d\udcca\ud83d\udca1\u2063 \n\nI know it might seem like a high number, but remember, the stock market does all the hard work for us! The key is to start early and let time work its magic as our most valuable asset when it comes to investing. \u23f3\ud83d\udcaa \n\nBut here's the secret: you can reach financial freedom even sooner if you incorporate alternative assets with higher cash flow into your investment mix! \ud83c\udfd8\ufe0f\ud83d\udcb0\u2063 \n\nPersonally, I invest in real estate investment trusts, mortgage

made me rich was investing when other people were scared.\n\nA lot of people think recessions are where people lose money, but the reality is that's where the most millionaires are made.\n\nLet's think back to the 2008 crisis in the US. Housing prices plummeted, stock prices fell almost 50%. It may seem counterintuitive, but it's actually the best time to make money.\n\nYou see most people do the opposite of what a good investor does.\n\nWhen things are going well, and prices are sky high, they invest. They get emotional. They think they're missing out. So they pile in their money.\n\nThey buy when prices are high.\n\nThe key to making money investing is buying when prices are low, and letting the market do all the heavy lifting to make you rich when it goes back up.\n\nThat's because the market as a whole has always gone back up, and if it didn't, it would mean the entire economy has completely failed and we'd have much bigger things to worry about. This is something that the governments and ultra wealthy would never allow to happen.\n\nIf you had invested $10,000 into the S&P500 (which is a basket of stocks belonging to 500 of some of the biggest or best companies in America)  in January 2009 in the middle of the financial crisis, today you'd have over $73,000. \n\nYou would have made $63,000 in free money, just by learning how to put your money in the right places.\n\nNow I was still a baby in 2008, but during the covid crash in 2020 I focused on super charging my contributions, and it's helped build my wealth.\n\nIf you have the right strategy and can take emotions out of it, you could get really rich.\n\nI'm excited for the next crash.

It also has an 80-90% death rate. But there's a 2% chance you could do better than option 1 with your recovery. \n\nWith stats like that, why would anyone ever pick option two? \n\nBecause of overconfidence bias. They believe that they'll be the ~one~ who gets better results than everyone. \n\nIs this just my opinion? No, it's based on facts and data. \n\nSo you can choose the easy proven route, or you can take your chances with the other. The boring, tried and true option is better here, and it's better for investing as well. \n\nDepending on the study you look at, between 80-90% of day traders lose money, with 98% of them unable to beat the index. \n\nStop gambling with your money, and learn the right way to build wealth. \n\nGrab your spot in our free investing masterclass to keep learning.

I realized really early on that I didn't want a prestigious job title, I just wanted freedom. I wanted money. I wanted to be able to travel where and whenever I wanted. \n\nAnd that's the life I'm living right now. Learning how to get here will take a little effort, this is the high maintenance part, but now my life is so low maintenance that I actually make money without working. \n\nWhat I would do is everytime I got paid, instead of just thinking of my savings as whatever money was leftover in my checking account between paychecks, or putting it into my savings account earning pennies on the dollar, I'd have an automatic transfer set up.\n\nI would send this money over into my brokerage, this is a company that gives you access to the stock market.\n\nOnce the money was in my account, I'd use it to buy a share of something called an ETF. Buying one of these can allow you to become a part owner in hundreds or thousands of companies, so you start getting paid like a business owner without having to work.\n\nIf the investment is more than you have to invest, you can just but a fractional share instead - so you're buying a piece, but it does the same thing: make you money while you sleep so you can start to live a soft life.\n\nNow my investments pay me out over 6 figures a year. This obviously didn't happen over night, but the only real way to live a soft life ever (and not work until you die) is to invest.\n\nStart learning with our free Investing Masterclass.

I grew up broke, here's the house I spent the first 10 years of my life in. \n\nI watched my parents struggle with money my entire childhood. I figured that if I worked hard, I could change my situation a little, but not too much, and that I'd probably always struggle myself. \n\nBut when I realized the sneaky things that were keeping me broke and changed them, I was able to become a millionaire at 30. I believed money wouldn't solve my problems - this is a broke mindset, and the saying \"money doesn't buy happiness\" is pushed on the lower and middle classes by the rich so we think \"this is as good as it gets\". \n\nNow that I'm rich I will tell you 100% money does buy happiness - because it buys safety, security, and fulfillment. It may not solve everything, but its a lot easier to handle my mental health problems when I don't have to go to work, can take a vacation whenever I want, and afford a therapist. \n\nI believed it was hard to get rich, but here's the thing: if you don't believe you can have more money, you never will. This is because what you tell the brain it believes, and what you believe is how you act, and your actions get you all the results you have in life. \n\nWhen I believed I had to work hard to make money, I got a second job, worked overtime. When I changed my belief to \"money gets to be easy\", I started looking for ways to make money while I slept. \n\nI invested more instead of working harder, and now I make 6 figures a year while I sleep.

This chart breaks it all down. For example, if you're saving 10% of your income, you'd need to work for 51 years to be financially free. You can cut this down exponentially by increasing your savings rate - if you were able to save 30% of your income, you'd hit your number in just 28 years. \n\nThis may seem daunting, but the easiest way to increase your savings rate is by increasing your income but keeping your expenses the same. \n\nThis brings me to the second mistake I see people make, and that's lifestyle creep. They start to make more so they spend more, they get a bigger house or a nicer car, and all of a sudden they have more things but no more freedom. \n\nThat higher salary becomes nothing more than golden handcuffs. \n\nThe third biggest mistake I see people make is that they'll just stick this money into a savings account earning pennies on the dollar not knowing this means they're just LOSING money due to inflation. \n\nYou need to put that money to work, you don't have 50,000 dollars, you have 50,000 workers - if you never find ways to get your money to work in place you, you will work until you die. \n\nStart learning with our free money trainings or apply to work with me as your 7 figure mentor \ud83e\udd0d", "total_engagement": 490, "engagement_rate": 0.005331128349634981, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-08-18T00:32:24.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "thousands", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "women", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "someone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "income", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mistake", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "debt", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mistakes", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "job", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "millionaire", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132235316101, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:27.493Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:27.493Z"}, {"id": 607775132235316100, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1149084411", "created_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:27.488Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:27.488Z"}, {"id": 607775132235565242, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-27T15:19:43.244Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.348Z"}, {"id": 607775132235565243, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-27T15:19:43.249Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.356Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175241651509, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CwF7p1dpb2k/", "post_id": "3172203872200801700", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/8f9903bcf68b1b56e8d650336f6f3bda.JPEG", "phash": "8d9003d17e4f3c3b", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beauty", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8986846208572388}, {"entity": "cheek", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8940761685371399}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7686084508895874}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6729789972305298}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5030845403671265}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5012332797050476}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.47233790159225464}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4339369237422943}, {"entity": "undershirt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.41655004024505615}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3982779085636139}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3379538357257843}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2876605689525604}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23800958693027496}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8757752776145935}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6054505109786987}, {"entity": "blouse", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5354815125465393}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24681426584720612}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-08-25T08:44:29.724Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T06:14:14.239Z"}}], "post_text": "If you work a stressful job you don't want to be at forever but stay because you make good money - this is for you.\n\nI'm going to show you how you can transition into working part time while mainting your lifestyle with something called Barista FIRE.\n\nBatista FIRE is when you have enough money invested to cover some of your living expenses, but you take a low stress part time job to fill the gap, or sometimes just for the health insurance.\n\nThese FIRE strategies aren't for the faint of heart, but if you're willing to put in the effort you can be financially free in your 30s or 40s. \n\nI followed a similar strategy and am set to retire in my 30s with 6 figures a year in passive income.\n\nStep one: you're going to increase your savings rate - if you don't want to stay at your high stress job forever, this part is key. The higher your savings rate, the less years you'll have to work. \n\nIf you were able to save 50% of your income, you could reach full retirement in 17 years.\n\nStep two: you'll never be free just saving your money, so you're going to take that cash and put it into investments. Asset allocation funds, ETFs or index funds are the way to go.\n\nStep 3: once you've turned your savings into a money printing machine, you have a few options. Let's look at an example.\n\nLet's say you make $100,000 a year, and you put away 50%.\n\n1. In 10 years you could have almost $800,000 invested. This could provide you with $32,000 a year in income using the 4% rule, without risking running out of money. \n\nIf you were used to living on $50k, you could get a part time job to fill that $18k gap. This is Barista FIRE.\n\n2. Instead you could aim for full financial freedom and never have to work again. Keeping those investments growing for another 5 years would be enough for you to retire and maintain your lifestyle.\n\nKeep learning with our free trainings or apply to work with me as your 7 figure mentor \ud83e\udd0d", "total_engagement": 599, "engagement_rate": 0.006517032411084395, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-08-18T16:30:16.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "lifestyle", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "income", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "job", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132235316118, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:27.680Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:27.680Z"}, {"id": 607775132235316116, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1489293977", "created_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:27.676Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:27.676Z"}, {"id": 607775132235565246, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-27T15:19:43.278Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.377Z"}, {"id": 607775132235565248, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-27T15:19:43.282Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.382Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175241651506, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CwIuvbhJzmc/", "post_id": "3172991506984679836", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/11dbc3b9efad4c8ad3d2a6502956928a.JPEG", "phash": "c048dd1f263733bc", "image_entities": [{"entity": "cheek", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9169955849647522}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8779186010360718}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8374197483062744}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7873169779777527}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7855772376060486}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7842503190040588}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6138349175453186}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4794788956642151}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3617327809333801}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30198952555656433}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8049109578132629}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2748754620552063}, {"entity": "pen", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24299490451812744}, {"entity": "man", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23094308376312256}, {"entity": "business card", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20606037974357605}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-08-25T07:28:26.194Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T06:13:59.271Z"}}], "post_text": "If you're ready to stop working your ass off to make money, then watch this video - I'm going to show you how you can start getting paid while you sleep just by putting your money in the right places. \n\nThat's what I did, and I became a millionaire at 30. Now I teach others how its done. \n\nIf you invest $500 a month, let's see what that could grow to. Almost $360,000, and $240,000 in FREE money, for an hour or two of work a year. \n\nYour first step to do this is to open an account with a brokerage. In USA I like Vanguard, Fidelity and Charles Scwab. In Canada I like Wealthsimple and Questrade. \n\nYou'll want to open a tax sheltered account where possible. \n\nIn USA usually a Roth IRA is best, and in Canada that's your TFSA. Money you make in these accounts is 100% tax free! \n\nThen you'll want to choose your investments. You can do something like an asset allocation fund, that's everything you need all in one single click! \n\nThen set up automatic deposits into your investing account every time you get paid, turn on DRIP so any dividends you get (this is where companies you own share their profits with you) get reinvested and buy you more shares. \n\nThis helps you get rich faster. And that's it, then you let time and compound interest do its thing. \n\nKeep learning with our free investing masterclass, find it on our website under FREEBIES \ud83e\udd0d", "total_engagement": 402, "engagement_rate": 0.0043737012174556375, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-08-19T18:36:12.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "companies", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "video", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "places", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "others", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "account", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "step", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ass", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "millionaire", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132235316130, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:27.906Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:27.906Z"}, {"id": 607775132235316129, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-2090435883", "created_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:27.903Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:27.903Z"}, {"id": 607775132235565255, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-27T15:19:43.301Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.401Z"}, {"id": 607775132235565257, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-27T15:19:43.306Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.407Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175241651504, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CwK-TEKtumT/", "post_id": "3173622876464408979", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/129f76dcb2566620fc08780cea65734b.JPEG", "phash": "aef3c88dcf3600b1", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beauty", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9849616289138794}, {"entity": "cheek", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8941148519515991}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8815131783485413}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8813830614089966}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8795661330223083}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8253216743469238}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7600336670875549}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7089475393295288}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5764322280883789}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5085656642913818}, {"entity": "black hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3297635614871979}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2371700257062912}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21475975215435028}, {"entity": "lipstick", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2111242264509201}, {"entity": "lipstick", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.874047577381134}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8724257946014404}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4551984667778015}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3080703914165497}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.298371821641922}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-08-25T09:39:25.577Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T06:13:57.359Z"}}], "post_text": "I just got paid out almost $3,900 from one of my investments for the month of August, this is money that just shows up in my bank account without me having to do anything for it. \n\nThis investment has allowed me to reach financial freedom sooner, because it provides a higher level of consistent cash flow than stocks. \n\nWhen you invest in stocks, you use something called the 4% rule to determine your \"never have to work again\" number. How this works is if you determine you need say $40k a year to support your lifestyle, you would multiply this by 25 to find out what you'd need to get there. Using stocks this would be $1M - where $40k a year would be 4%. \n\nBecause this investment pays me out 10%, I can reach my number with less. Now I'd never tell you to put all your eggs in one basket, but for the sake of this example let's say you wanted that same $40k a year in income, you could get there with only $400k invested - that's $600k less. \n\nThis doesn't take into account any diversification or inflation, so I have other investments that cover me for those purposes (like stocks, REITs and real estate). But using this strategy I've been able to create over 6 figures a year in passive income so that I no longer have to work for money. \n\nA MIC is a mortgage investment corporation, basically I pool my money with other investors to loan out and I get paid the interest. \n\nSome of these can be super risky, so you need to make sure you do your research before you start. \n\nIf you want to learn more about red flags and what to look out for, let me know in the comments and I'll make a follow up video! \ud83d\udc99", "total_engagement": 622, "engagement_rate": 0.006767269047903996, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-08-20T15:30:37.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "investment", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "freedom", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mortgage investment", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "anything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132235316139, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:28.074Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:28.074Z"}, {"id": 607775132235316136, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1344251816", "created_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:28.058Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:28.058Z"}, {"id": 607775132235565258, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-27T15:19:43.324Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.426Z"}, {"id": 607775132235565260, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-27T15:19:43.332Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.431Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175241651503, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CwNwqwTpSCF/", "post_id": "3174407356685820037", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/588a0bfc3075cadbee13d0fad805c56c.JPEG", "phash": "a8d2a3bd1a38711f", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beauty", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9755684733390808}, {"entity": "black hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8723077178001404}, {"entity": "cushion", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7437277436256409}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7341973781585693}, {"entity": "belt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.643159806728363}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6095317602157593}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4775620102882385}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3611329197883606}, {"entity": "driving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.32889315485954285}, {"entity": "hairstyle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3254590332508087}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.32007408142089844}, {"entity": "headrest", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.31747761368751526}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30426111817359924}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3005102574825287}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.29564911127090454}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22308777272701263}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21787168085575104}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3919200003147125}, {"entity": "blouse", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.33034810423851013}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-08-25T06:42:14.442Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T06:13:28.476Z"}}], "post_text": "Here are my top 4 money tips for people in their 30s who feel like they've fallen behind, and want to get un-stuck. \n\nIt is not too late to be rich. \n\nI went from $40k debt to a millionaire at 30, now I teach others how its done. \n\n1. If you're feeling like you can't save money, then we either have an expenses problem or an income problem. Write out your fixed expenses, these are the things you HAVE to pay for every month. \n\nIf they're higher than 60% of your income, you won't have the flexibility to save. \n\n2. Calculate your never have to work again number, even if you \"love your job\", choosing to work is a luxury you want to afford. \n\nTo do this take your desired annual spend, and multiply is by 25. \n\nThis is how much you'd need to never work again. It may seem high, but when you put your money in the right places it works FOR you and makes you rich. 3. Start investing - time, not money, is your most valuable asset due to compound interest. \n\nBuilding a $100k investing account by 35 can grow to over $1M by traditional retirement without you ever saving another dollar, because you gave it enough time to grow. The longer you wait, the more you'll have to save. \n\nI have a free investing masterclass, on my website under FREEBIES to help you get started. \n\n4. Stop letting your employer under pay you - the easiest way to save more money is to make more money, and the easiest way to make more without working harder is by learning how to negotiate. \n\nMy students have gotten 10%, 20% and even 30% more just by learning how to ask for their worth.", "total_engagement": 263, "engagement_rate": 0.0028614015427632653, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-08-21T17:29:15.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "students", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "luxury", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "income", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "debt", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "others", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "millionaire", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132235316147, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:28.214Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:28.214Z"}, {"id": 607775132235316146, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-191547008", "created_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:28.211Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-27T13:51:28.211Z"}, {"id": 607775132235565266, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-08-27T15:19:43.357Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.453Z"}, {"id": 607775132235565267, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-08-27T15:19:43.362Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.458Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175241651491, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CwQVY6jrHcN/", "post_id": "3175131808415905549", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/a8700768305d449a29c77dae4713ec37.JPEG", "phash": "be84839cef9e0487", "image_entities": [{"entity": "belt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8687334060668945}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6851729154586792}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5477174520492554}, {"entity": "driving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4276462197303772}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3059912919998169}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.26841282844543457}, {"entity": "headrest", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.26562514901161194}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2652931809425354}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2550601363182068}, {"entity": "vehicle door", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.25355586409568787}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4798997938632965}, {"entity": "staircase", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.37299245595932007}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2399437129497528}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21400617063045502}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.21347709000110626}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-08-25T08:44:27.180Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T06:13:25.590Z"}}], "post_text": "If you're making over $50,000 a year in Canada, did you know that you can use your income tax to create a tax free stream of income?\n\nLet's look at how you can do this with an example. Say you're making $70,000 a year in Ontario.\n\nAt that income level you would owe $12,847 in taxes for the year - but you know about this strategy so you're not going to pay that much.\n\nInstead you're going to invest $10,000 into your RRSP.\n\nBecause your RRSP uses pre tax dollars, you get a tax write off for your contributions. After investing $10,000 into your RRSP you'd get a refund of $2,965. \n\nThat's money you would have paid to the government, but instead the government has paid it back to you.\n\nNow you're not going to spend this money, you're going to deposit it into your TFSA and use it to buy REITs or high dividend ETFs. \n\nThese types of investments can provide you with monthly cash flow, that's a stream of income you don't have to work for, and the money is tax free because it's invested through your tax free savings account.\n\nLet's say you do this and buy something like ZRE, which has a 5.04% dividend. In 10 years you could have created yourself almost $2,500 a year in passive income with money you would have just paid in taxes. This doesn't include the growth of that investment over time, or the growth of the money in your RRSP.\n\nKeep learning how to win with money + build a fat bank account with our free trainings.

It\u2019s based on the things we saw our parents and caregivers do and say about money while we were growing up - like \u201cwe don\u2019t have the money for that\u201d or \u201cyou have to work hard to make money\u201d, create subconscious rules in our brain.\n\nIt can be the reason why you keep dipping into your savings account to go shopping even when you said you\u2019ll stop, why you feel guilty when you buy anything even if you really need it, why you avoid opening bills, or why you overwork yourself.\n\nThe good news is that you can change your Money Babe Persona to one that benefits you instead of keeps you stuck, and the first step in changing it is learning all about it.\n\nI\u2019ve created a free quiz to help you figure out your Money Babe Persona, along with actionable money

make 6 figures a year in cash flow and become financially free in my 30s. \n\nLet's talk. \n\nA MIC is a mortgage investment corporation, basically I pool my money with other investors to loan out and I get paid the interest. \n\nSome of these can be super risky, so you need to make sure you do your research before you start - I'm going to go over a few that I would never invest in at the end of the video. \n\nWhen you're thinking about making any investment, you want to be doing it from a defensive standpoint. Remember how you were taught to drive defensively, because you can't control the other people on the road? That's how we invest. We can't control the market, but we can control our actions to keep our money safe. \n\nSo, we need to go into every investment decision thinking: how do I make sure I don't lose money? \n\nHere are some key factors I look at: \n\nLoan to value ratio: this is how much of the value of the home is being loaned out. The higher the ratio, the higher the risk. \n\nMortgage position: this determines who gets paid out first when the house is sold, there can be first, second and third mortgages. The higher the position, the higher the risk. \n\nBorrower: you need to understand who is getting these mortgages and why. Is it because they're blue collar workers and getting paid under the table, so they're not showing enough income to get a loan from a regular bank, or is it because they're a credit risk, or trying to finance something the banks won't? \n\nNote: I'd never invest in a MIC that lends to developers, especially not one that covers \"soft costs\" of development that banks won't lend to, like sales offices and staffing. I also won't do loans to businesses, or long term loans. \n\nThe MICs I invest in offer short term 6-12 month bridge loans only. \n\nThis is not an exhaustive list but a good place to start your research!\n\nLet's close that knowledge gap and get you wealthy and paid!

Becoming wealthy is a mindset first - money is either attracted to you or repelled by you based on the way you think. \n\nThis means if you\u2019re always scared about losing money, or thinking you\u2019ll never get ahead with money, money will not be attracted to you. \n\nBut if you\u2019re always thinking about ways that money is abundant, and how you can bring more into your life, your brain will act accordingly and start to see challenges as opportunities. You\u2019ll get gritty, and you\u2019ll do the things that need to be done to get rich. \n\nThis is why mindset is at the core of everything I teach - it doesn\u2019t matter how much tactic you learn, like the right accounts to use or best investments to buy - if your mindset doesn\u2019t align with being rich, you won\u2019t be. \n\nGetting money isn\u2019t the action, it\u2019s the result of inner work coupled with million dollar tactic. \n\nThe second thing I\u2019d do is figure out why even when I know what I\u2019m supposed to do to build wealth, I\u2019m not doing it - so many people have tools to succeed but they keep getting in their own damn way. \n\nThis is because of something I call your Money Babe Persona. Your Money Babe Persona is like an internal program running in the background making your decisions for you, and psychologists widely believe that these beliefs were formed by the time you were 7 years old. \n\nThat means if you haven\u2019t taken the time to update them, you\u2019re letting a child make your financial decisions - I\u2019ll let you tell me if that\u2019s a good thing or not. \n\nI\u2019ve created a free quiz to help you figure out your Money Babe Persona, along with tips specific to your money type to help you start winning. \n\nAfter you take the quiz you\u2019ll get a series of emails with more freebies, like 20 things you can do to change your financial situation right now, and our No Budget Babe Financial Audit. \n\nFind it at nobudgetbabe.com/Quiz", "total_engagement": 302, "engagement_rate": 0.003285715839979111, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-08-29T20:30:56.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mindset", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "wealthy", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132262280493, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-03T09:05:13.953Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-03T09:05:13.953Z"}, {"id": 607775132262280492, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "156202429", "created_at": "2023-09-03T09:05:13.944Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-03T09:05:13.944Z"}, {"id": 607775132262392550, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-03T15:05:30.082Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.638Z"}, {"id": 607775132262392551, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-09-03T15:05:30.097Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.643Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175258114880, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cwk_aIIRJ0B/", "post_id": "3180946109195656449", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [], "post_text": "My life was a rollercoaster of financial ups and downs before I learned how to get out of my own damn way.\n\nI'd save, then blow my budget, shame myself, stop spending, then feel restricted so I'd binge.\n\nI knew what I was \"supposed to do,\" but I wasn't doing it.

It's the 8th wonder of the world that turns small amounts of money into large amounts of money over time. \n\nLike how it can turn $50 a month into hundreds of thousands of dollars in free money. \n\nSounds too good to be true, but its not. But how do you actually get it? I'm a self made millionaire who used the power of compound interest to be financially free in my 30s, let's talk. \n\nUnlike simple interest which gives you free money only on your initial investment, compound interest pays you out on the original sum AND will pay you interest on the interest you earned. \n\nIt becomes like a supercharged money printing machine. The easiest way to start earning compound interest is by opening something called a High Yield Savings Account. \n\nThese are paying upwards of 4% in the US right now - its just like a regular savings account but gives you free money. \n\nI would use this for my emergency fund and my short term goals. For my long term goals I'd want to invest that money into the stock market so I could make more. \n\nThe average return of the total stock market is 10% a year, meaning each year your money could earn 10%, and then you'd start earning money on the free money too. \n\nImagine you started saving $300 a month at 25 for 30 years, you'd have $108,000, but if you invested that money instead you could have over $618,000 - that's a half million dollars more just for learning how to put your money in the right places and earn compound interest. \n\nKeep learning with our free trainings, on our website under FREEBIES \ud83e\udd0d", "total_engagement": 221, "engagement_rate": 0.002404447684223124, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-08-30T18:58:40.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "amounts", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "world", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "wonder", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "everyone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "interest", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "millionaire", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132262280499, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-03T09:05:14.355Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-03T09:05:14.355Z"}, {"id": 607775132262280498, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "515800041", "created_at": "2023-09-03T09:05:14.351Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-03T09:05:14.351Z"}, {"id": 607775132262392556, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-03T15:05:30.239Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.687Z"}, {"id": 607775132262392557, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-09-03T15:05:30.261Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.693Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175258114907, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CwlNfHAqJ07/", "post_id": "3181008024242789691", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/8779674c6606f4f58051949c3d40dd5d.JPEG", "phash": "95116aed97113e6a", "image_entities": [{"entity": "advertisement", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8434306979179382}, {"entity": "brochure", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5674552917480469}, {"entity": "flyer", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.534662663936615}, {"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5160617828369141}, {"entity": "paper", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.45301395654678345}, {"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34766510128974915}, {"entity": "document", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.33982589840888977}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2883066236972809}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9375527501106262}, {"entity": "flyer", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8631293177604675}, {"entity": "business card", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24540933966636658}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-09-01T04:01:01.636Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T06:14:47.694Z"}}], "post_text": "A Single Mom's Incredible Financial Turnaround! \ud83c\udf1f \n\nMeet Amber, a current student in the Makin\u2019 Money Moves Coaching Program.\n\nBefore joining our program, Amber was caught in a financial whirlwind as a single mom of three.

I dropped the budget blues, and brought in the Money Babe Persona (MBP). \n\nThink of your MBP as your internal money GPS, formed way back when.

Look at this:\n\nThe rule of 72 says if you divide the interest rate you are getting by 72, it tells you how long it will take for your money to double. \n\nLet's say you had $10,000 in a regular savings account where the average return is 0.55, it will take 130 years for your money to double.\n\nBut, if you put your $10,000 into the stock market, earning an average 10% a year, it will only take 7 years for your money to double.\n\nThe growth after this is exponential.\n\nBecause while it took 7 years for your $10,000 to turn into $20,000, it will only take 7 years to turn that $20,000 in to $40,000, then that $40,000 into $80,000.\n\nThis concept is how you can turn $50 a month into hundreds of thousands of dollars in free money, and is why getting to the golden goose bank account of $100k by 35 means you'll retire a millionaire even if you never saved another dollar.\n\nReady to keep learning?

made millionaire. \n\nI hope this reaches the right person, because this could just be the thing that changes everything for you.\n\n1. This is going to be controversial, but you need to start setting small goals.\n\nYour girl loves a big goal, I became a millionaire and published author in my 30s - but if I woke up everyday telling myself \"you just need to make a million dollars\", I would have been overwhelmed as shit.\n\nInstead, I set small realistic laddered goals that built on each other for myself so I could avoid analysis paralysis.\n\nSo for example, if you really want to save a $25k down payment for a house, maybe you break that down like this:\n\nDown Payment: $25k \nTimeline for Goal: 2 years \nMonthly: $1041 \nDaily: $34.25 \n\nNow you can ask yourself, how can I save $34.25 a day? Negotiate some bills, sell stuff you don't need, pick up a weekend bartending shift. $35 feels a lot more manageable than $25,000 - when things feel easy, they become easy.\n\n2. You need to stop making your own mistakes.\n\nAs a recovering perfectionist, this speaks to me. Let someone else do the hard shit, and then learn from them.\n\nI started selling real estate and became a top broker in less than a year, and it's because I had a mentor who taught me exactly what NOT to do. Instead of me taking time, energy and money trying to figure it out, he just gave me the roadmap to success.\n\n3. You need to just GSD mode it.\n\nThe Law of Diminishing Intent says the longer you wait to take action on a goal, the less likely you are to do it.\n\nGSD mode stands for Get Shit Done. \n\nHow long have you been talking about saving money, paying off your student loans or negotiating a raise? \n\nThe longer you wait the less likely it is you're going to do it, and the harder it's going to be. \n\nEnter your rich girl era, start learning how to build your dream life with our free trainings or apply to work with me as your 7 figure mentor \ud83e\udd0d link in bye-o", "total_engagement": 239, "engagement_rate": 0.002600285052168899, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-09-09T16:30:13.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "author", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thing", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "self", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "millionaire", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goal", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "everything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "video", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goals", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "guys", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mentor", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "shit", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "girl", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "habits", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132296804540, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-15T14:34:29.656Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T14:34:29.656Z"}, {"id": 607775132296804539, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-455557088", "created_at": "2023-09-15T14:34:29.651Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-15T14:34:29.651Z"}, {"id": 607775132300758035, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-16T12:06:00.053Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.869Z"}, {"id": 607775132300758036, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-09-16T12:06:00.107Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:14.875Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175272391046, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CxBJsvNMmFY/", "post_id": "3188872667917869400", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/d6b4e4bb8ae57693f9bcefa44c741db0.JPEG", "phash": "c9f2c6f9931c310e", "image_entities": [{"entity": "cheek", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8722100853919983}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7549219131469727}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.657192051410675}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6162117719650269}, {"entity": "facial expression", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5490444302558899}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4399053156375885}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.42351311445236206}, {"entity": "hairstyle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34023183584213257}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3298420310020447}, {"entity": "teeth", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30236464738845825}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.26356518268585205}, {"entity": "smile", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20160146057605743}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9295652508735657}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.469552606344223}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3915385901927948}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-09-13T08:26:30.588Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T06:15:26.568Z"}}], "post_text": "I'm a self made millionaire, here are 5 money lessons you should know by 30 if you want to be rich. \n\n1. Expensive weddings are correlated with shorter marriages. A recent study found that couples whose weddings cost more than $20,000 were 1.6 times as likely to divorce than couples who spent between $5,000 and $10,000\u2014and those spending $1,000 or less had a lower-than-average divorce rate. \n\n2. Your home isn't an investment - it's your shelter. Most people's homes are their \"best investment\" because they've never actually invested. It doesn't matter if your home has gone up in value, because so have all the other homes - unless you significantly downsize or move somewhere much cheaper, you're just living in your money. An investment pays YOU, YOU work to pay for a house - even when the mortgage is gone. \n\n3. You will never retire if you don't invest - pensions are a thing of the past for most people, and the lie we've been sold by society is that retirement is an age. It's not - it's simply a number in the bank, with assets like stocks or real estate that provide you enough cash flow to stop working. If you never hit this number, you will work forever. \n\n4. Investing is simple - instead of looking for a needle in a haystack while stock picking and gambling with your money, just buy the whole haystack. You can get something called an asset allocation fund that has everything in it you need, the same as a financial advisor would do for you but without the high fees. \n\nI have free trainings on my website under freebies to help you learn more. \n\n5. Kids are expensive - not just daycare costs and food, but in the amount of time you'll miss from work caring for them and the penalty that has on your lifetime earnings.", "total_engagement": 222,

Stop trying to budget. It is so much easier to increase your income than radically cut your expenses. If you make $60,000 a year and get a 10% raise (my students are making 10%, 20%, even 30% more by learning to negotiate), that's an extra $6k a year, or $500 a month that you can add right to your goals.\n\n2. If you are going to cut expenses, stop focusing on the little joys that make life worth living, and start going after the big boys - like your car and housing.\n\nIf you can negotiate your rent or move to a cheaper apartment saving $500 a month, you would have to cut 100 $5 coffees a month to net the same amount.\n\n3. Put your \"oh shit\" fund together. Now.\n\nYou know how life has a sneaky way of always throwing crap at us when we least expect it? Flat tire, cat needs to go to the vet, your work downsizes. We need to learn that these unexpected things are always going to happen, and the way we come out ahead is by expecting the unexpected. \n\nWe don't know what or when, but a steaming pile of crap will be waiting for us one day, and how good would it feel to just have a bank account stacked with cash to deal with it? \n\nThis needs to be 6-12 months of your bare bones expenses saved in a HYSA. \n\n4. Contact HR about your retirement accounts. \n\nIf you're not enrolled and they offer a dollar for dollar match, you're literally losing part of your salary - employers consider your 401k, or RRSP contributions part of your compensation.\n\nIf you are enrolled and you're decades away from retirement, make sure you're not in mid or low risk investments. This is a huge mistake I see a lot of people make, and it can cost you a TON of money.\n\nRemember: unless you have a fat pension, you will not retire unless you invest. The earlier you start the easier it is.\n\nLet's get you winning with money and building a bank account that never stops growing.

It's when your investments generate enough income for you to enjoy life without punching the clock. The earlier you start, the easier it gets!\n\nStep 1: Determine Your Retirement Income \ud83d\udcb8\nMost experts suggest aiming for 70-80% of your pre-retirement income. Sounds like a lot, right? But remember, in retirement, some expenses drop - student loans, commuting, etc.\n\nExample: If you currently make $60,000, aim for $42,000 in retirement.\n\nStep 2: Invest Smart \ud83d\udca1\nInvesting in the stock market is your ticket to ride. It grows faster than a savings account, beats inflation, and harnesses the power of compound interest.\n\nStep 3: Calculate Your Retirement Nest Egg \ud83e\udd5a\nMultiply your desired retirement income by 25. For our example, it's $1,050,000.\n\nDon't freak out! You're not saving it all; you're investing it wisely.

Simple \u2013 because I don't see it as an investment. Here's why:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **It's Highly Speculative:** Crypto's value isn't rooted in a tangible asset or company. It's driven by market sentiment. You're essentially betting on whether someone else will find it more valuable than what you paid for it.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Lack of Income Generation:** When you invest in stocks or real estate, you're buying into something that generates income \u2013 dividends, rent, or profit from a business. Crypto doesn't do that.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Risk of Pure Speculation:** Sure, some folks have made money in crypto, just like some people win the lottery.

They're like special containers that hold your investments. Confusing them can lead to missing out on any growth inside your account.\n\nYou need to buy investments within your account to see your money grow, otherwise it's just losing value due to inflation.\n\n\ud83e\udd14 **The Fix:** Understand what's inside these accounts. Are you invested in stocks, bonds, or other assets? Diversify wisely based on your goals!\n\n\ud83d\ude80 **Mistake 2: Playing it Too Safe for Too Long** \ud83d\ude80\n\nBeing in low-risk funds when you're years or even decades away from retirement can actually be riskier! You might miss out on the growth potential that can secure your future.\n\n\u23f3 **The Fix:** Assess your risk tolerance and adjust your portfolio accordingly. Time is your ally for long-term growth.\n\nWhen you're younger and have more years before retirement, you can afford to take more \"risk\". The bigger risk becomes not having enough money to ever stop working when you're investing in \"safe\" or \"balanced\" funds in your 20s and 30s.\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 **Mistake 3: Falling for High-Cost Mutual Funds** \ud83d\udcb8\n\nEvery percent in fees matters! High-cost mutual funds can eat away at your returns. A mere 1% difference in fees could mean a decade less of retirement income. Ouch!\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **The Fix:** Opt for low-cost index funds or ETFs. They offer similar market exposure with significantly lower fees, leaving more money in your pocket.\n\nKeep learning with our free trainings \ud83d\udd25  find them on our website under FREEBIES!", "total_engagement": 368, "engagement_rate": 0.0040037861891136185, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-09-21T15:31:36.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "thousands", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "something", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "hundreds", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "account", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132330421459, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-28T05:31:09.285Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-28T05:31:09.285Z"}, {"id": 607775132330421458, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-2020880473", "created_at": "2023-09-28T05:31:09.219Z", "updated_at": "2023-09-28T05:31:09.219Z"}, {"id": 607775132330579010, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-09-28T15:12:45.238Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:15.161Z"}, {"id": 607775132330579011, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-09-28T15:12:45.246Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:15.165Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175286435229, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CxgRR29PX8I/", "post_id": "3197631729464344328", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/658da763e219fc88061d1d1473bef6d7.JPEG", "phash": "ad90eeb381f5898c", "image_entities": [{"entity": "arm", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7394189238548279}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6488882303237915}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5798065662384033}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5654945373535156}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5314395427703857}, {"entity": "hairstyle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4207044541835785}, {"entity": "neck", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3809962570667267}, {"entity": "t-shirt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.36916273832321167}, {"entity": "shoulder", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.31631118059158325}, {"entity": "t-shirt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3149731159210205}, {"entity": "clock tower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8663457036018372}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8404505848884583}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6348549723625183}, {"entity": "shoe", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4013718366622925}, {"entity": "man", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3189464211463928}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3099309504032135}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-09-25T01:23:48.640Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T06:16:09.169Z"}}], "post_text": "\ud83e\udde0 Unlocking the Power of Your Money Mindset! \ud83d\udcb0\n\nDid you realize that your thoughts aren't just yours? \ud83e\udd14\n\nBelieve it or not, those thoughts you think are your own might have been crafted long before you realized.

I would go through periods of feeling super motivated, then frustrated and anxious and guilty.\n\nI'd lie in bed awake at night stressing about bills, things I bought last week and how I shouldn't have bought them. I was feeling trapped and stuck, but even though I hated how I felt, everytime I made progress I'd just fall back into the same shit. It's like I didn't know how to say no to myself, I ALWAYS had a justification for why I needed to buy something in the moment.\n\nI did this for YEARS, trying to budget and shame myself into being someone different. What I didn't realize was that those tactics were just keeping me stuck - we only successfully change our habits when we start seeing ourselves as the highest and best version we can be. But I couldn't get there, because everytime I failed I thought it was proof I'd never get ahead.\n\nThe thing that changed everything for me was when I found out the reasons WHY I was doing what I was doing, because once I understood those beliefs and actions I could break them down and create new ones that benefited my specific situation.\n\nYour Money mindset, or your Money Babe Persona as I now call it, is like an internal computer program running the shots for your financial decisions - and its formed by the time you're 7 years old. If you've never taken the time to update it, that means the seven year old version of yourself is making your money decisions today.\n\nBut once I learned how to rewrite those beliefs to serve me. Then I was able to incorporate the winning strategies. That made me a millionaire at 30 period money got to be easy. I saved my first 100 K by 25, I bought my dream house, I paid for my wedding and cash all because I learned how to rewrite the behaviors that were holding me back. \n\nWe have a new free quiz and live

No gatekeeping here besties.\n\nThe first thing I had to do to go from $40k debt to a millionaire at 30 was create big goals that scared the shit out of me - if you\u2019re playing small, you\u2019re going to get small results.\n\nThe rich set crazy goals and they plan everything meticulously - they didn\u2019t get rich by hoping, wishing and praying they would, they got rich by reverse engineering their goals.\n\nDon't start with small goals, start with big goals and turn them into smaller more manageable bite sized goals so you have a laddered approach to success! \n\nThe next thing I had to learn was that just like your success in marriage is determined by your relationship with your partner, the beliefs and thoughts you have about each other, your financial success is determined by the relationship you have with your money.\u00a0\n\nMoney is literally either attracted to you or repelled from you based on how you think about it.\u00a0\n\nYour money beliefs create what I call your Money Babe Persona - this is like a computer program running in the background making all of your financial decisions for you.

When we recognize the cost of inaction, it becomes a powerful motivator. Think about it: What opportunities could slip away if we don't take action? \ud83d\ude31\n\n\u23f0 **Temporal Discounting:** We tend to prioritize immediate pleasure over future rewards. That quick indulgence might be tempting, but it often stands in the way of our long-term goals.

Now, contrast it with the potential outcomes of inaction \u2013 dreams left unfulfilled and chances missed. This mental exercise is a catalyst for change!\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Goal Alignment:** Aligning your daily actions with your long-term goals is key. Don't let momentary comfort derail your journey. Remember, that daily grind is what paves the way to your success! \ud83c\udfe2\n\n\ud83d\ude2c **Cognitive Dissonance:** That uneasy feeling when you don't take action?

To get that credit score boost, here are two strategies:\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Pay down your balance by $1,500 if you can. \ud83d\udd04\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 If you can't do that right away, consider increasing your credit limit (only if you trust yourself not to rack up more debt).\n\nLet's say you raise your limit to $15,000. Now that $4,500 balance is back to that magical 30%! \ud83c\udf1f\n\n(4500/15000)\n\nReady to build a fat bank account and FINALLY start winning with money?

I know you're going through a challenging time right now, and I wanted to remind you of something incredibly important: the limitless possibilities that lie ahead.\n\nLife has a weird way of teaching us lessons and shaping our journey. We can't go back in time to change our past, and honestly, we shouldn't dwell on it too much. What truly matters is the here and now, and the infinite opportunities that await us in the future.\n\nThink of life as a maze, with countless twists and turns. Sometimes, all it takes is a small decision, like choosing right instead of left, to open up an entirely new life path. It's like the famous butterfly effect, where the simple act of a butterfly flapping its wings could change the course of history. In our lives, one seemingly insignificant choice can have a profound impact on our future.\n\nSo, Babe, I want you to embrace this notion with all your heart. You are not defined by your past, but by the choices you make today and the ones you'll make tomorrow. Even when things seem tough, remember that there is beauty in uncertainty and potential in change.\n\nI believe in you and your ability to navigate this maze of life. You have the strength and resilience to make those small, powerful choices that will lead you to a brighter future. Don't be afraid to take a chance, to explore new possibilities, and to believe in the magic of the unknown.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, this difficult time you're going through is just one chapter of your life story. And I can't wait to see how the rest of the narrative unfolds because I know it will be filled with incredible adventures, growth, and joy.\n\nSending you love, strength, and a sense of wonder for the infinite possibilities ahead. \ud83c\udf1f\ud83e\udd8b\n\nTake care and keep moving forward,\n\nxx Nicole", "total_engagement": 172, "engagement_rate": 0.001871334849259626, "network_type":

can often tell whether they're destined for success? Let me illustrate this with a simple example.\n\nImagine a day where you get a parking ticket, receive a C on your assignment, and your friend doesn't wave goodbye. In one scenario, you might end up thinking, \"I must be an idiot for missing that 'no parking' sign. Getting a C just confirms I'm not smart enough. And my friend not waving goodbye? They probably don't even like me.\"\n\nThis is what we call a fixed mindset - the belief that you are who you are, and setbacks only reinforce negative self-perceptions. People stuck in this mindset tend to struggle with success because they don't seek opportunities or growth in the face of challenges.\n\nNow, let's meet Sara. She, too, gets a parking ticket, but she acknowledges it as a rushed mistake and plans to be more vigilant next time. She receives a C but realizes it's due to procrastination. Her solution? Better time management. When her friend doesn't wave goodbye, she assumes they were busy, not that they dislike her.\n\nSara embodies a growth mindset. She understands that abilities can be developed and improved upon.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that success isn't just about where you are; it's about where you can go. I can personally attest to this transformation, going from $40k in debt to becoming a millionaire at 30, thanks to embracing a growth mindset as the foundation. \ud83d\udcc8\n\nPossibilities are endless when you see failure as nothing more than a chance to try again \u2728\ufe0f \ud83d\udcaf", "total_engagement": 159, "engagement_rate": 0.0017298967501876775, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-10-02T17:37:17.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "success", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "assignment", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "someone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "friend", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goals", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "sara", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "goodbye", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mindset", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "c", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132336770939, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-03T13:44:19.705Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-03T13:44:19.705Z"}, {"id": 607775132336770938, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1520391111", "created_at": "2023-10-03T13:44:19.694Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-03T13:44:19.694Z"}, {"id": 607775132341631694, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:36.413Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:15.318Z"}, {"id": 607775132341631695, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-10-05T13:17:36.450Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:15.323Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175306447154, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CyRTo0_P2wQ/", "post_id": "3211434377850350608", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/1e28de5137bcb610b612151669072901.JPEG", "phash": "ae9178ee302fcc52", "image_entities": [{"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9301873445510864}, {"entity": "belt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7219333052635193}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6710404753684998}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6670069694519043}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5587767958641052}, {"entity": "driving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5191057920455933}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3980536162853241}, {"entity": "seat belt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.36979398131370544}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.34039178490638733}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2764623165130615}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.26466548442840576}, {"entity": "photo", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2264603078365326}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.22407543659210205}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2131475806236267}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7067482471466064}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6613686084747314}, {"entity": "staircase", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.46000736951828003}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.44321104884147644}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3475778102874756}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.32392436265945435}, {"entity": "helmet", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2202841192483902}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-10-21T03:02:47.780Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T06:18:39.261Z"}}], "post_text": "\ud83d\udcca Exploring Multiple Income Streams: Spotting Red Flags Like a Pro \ud83d\udea9\n\nHey there, my fellow go-getters! \ud83c\udf1f Let's chat about diving into the world of multiple income streams and making those moolah moves, all while dodging those sneaky red flags. It's all about securing that bag without losing a dime. \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udcb0\n\nSo, I had this recent encounter with a potential investment opportunity, and let me tell you, the red flags were waving like crazy. But hey, these flags aren't just warning signs; they're solid lessons in how to hustle smarter and protect your gains. \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udca1\n\n*1. Valuation Based on Potential Future Cash Flows:** They were pegging their company's value on potential future cash flows, with no clear income growth or strategy to back up the idea of 10x income in the near future. \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcb0\n\n**2. Expanding into New Markets:** They were planning to break into new markets. Sounds exciting, right? But hold on: \n - They hadn't mastered their current market yet.\n - Expanding means spending a ton of resources and time on product development. \ud83d\udca1\u23f3\n\n**3. Promising High Dividends:** To lure in investors, they were offering equity partners 25% of the company's gross revenues. \ud83c\udfa3\ud83e\udd11\n - But the sustainability of those projections is questionable, especially as expenses are bound to rise when they aim for that 10x revenue boost. \ud83d\udcca\ud83d\udcb2\n\nThe bottom line? \ud83d\udcc9 This investment felt too good to be true, especially in terms of returns, and the strategy didn't align with what I believe the business needed for success.\n\nSo, what's my plan now? I'm thinking of taking a different route: Investing in a \"boring\" business. Think laundromats or other ventures with minimal employees and stable demand, no matter what's happening in the world. \ud83e\uddfa\ud83c\udf0d\n\nHave you ever considered buying a business? \ud83e\udd14", "total_engagement": 168, "engagement_rate": 0.001827815434160565, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-10-11T19:35:21.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "world", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "encounter", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "income", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "strategy", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bag", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "streams", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "red flags", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132378096973, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-18T15:12:12.836Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-18T15:12:12.836Z"}, {"id": 607775132378096972, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1688341384", "created_at": "2023-10-18T15:12:12.820Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-18T15:12:12.820Z"}, {"id": 607775132381206688, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-19T13:56:56.804Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:15.344Z"}, {"id": 607775132381206689, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-10-19T13:56:56.832Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T08:29:15.351Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175306447093, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CyRW2BEquIE/", "post_id": "3211448478318912004", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/c41693061dba71b3ef07e8b21bd4f23f.JPEG", "phash": "91116ee8951f6e6a", "image_entities": [{"entity": "advertisement", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8470836281776428}, {"entity": "brochure", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4545922577381134}, {"entity": "flyer", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.42919474840164185}, {"entity": "font", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.39090389013290405}, {"entity": "paper", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3567187190055847}, {"entity": "poster", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.27536723017692566}, {"entity": "text message", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2358744889497757}, {"entity": "text", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23532938957214355}, {"entity": "id cards", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8671486377716064}, {"entity": "flyer", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7752751111984253}, {"entity": "business card", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3200535476207733}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-10-21T03:03:00.397Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-13T06:18:35.165Z"}}], "post_text": "IMAGINE NOT HAVING STUDENT DEBT?\n\nMichaela had a dream - to go back to school and earn a certification that would open doors to new opportunities.

affect your future \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\nExtending the timeline of loans might seem like a way to reduce costs, but here's the deal: It actually increases your total expenses because you end up paying more in interest. Yikes, right?\n\nInstead, if you're trying to save money on your debt the key is finding ways to lower the interest rate - extending the timeline is not the secret sauce you're looking for. How successful this will be depends on your credit score and the initial interest rate you agreed to (and your negotiation skills - which we teach in our coaching programs!).\n\nFor instance, we had a student with a low ~3% interest rate on her auto loan. With today's rates, even with good credit, she likely won't be able to reduce that. \ud83d\ude97\ud83d\udcb8\n\nBut here's where it gets interesting: If she had initially purchased the car when her credit was lower (and improved it since) or signed on with a higher rate (say, 13%), there'd be room to explore refinancing options with another lender for a lower rate. Credit improvement can be a focus, leading to better loan terms. \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc9\n\n(this means more money in your pocket)\n\nWhile it may sound enticing, extending the loan term, however, only means paying more in the long run. \ud83c\udfe5\ud83d\udcb2\n\nThe big question here is: What's your ultimate goal? \n\nSaving more money overall, or having more \"savings today\" and kicking the can (aka responsibility) down the road to future you.\n\nYou always need to ensure that your daily efforts align with long-term goals. If you focus on \"spending less today\" on debts that you'll be repaying well into the future, you'll hinder your future financial success.\n\nI teach you about money, follow for more or check our link in bio to start learning with our free trainings.

Wealth \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcca \n\nHey there, future Mega Money Babes! \ud83c\udf89 As I gear up to celebrate my 33rd birthday in November with a $5 million net worth, I've decided to share the 33 crucial money lessons I wish I'd known in my 20s to accelerate my wealth journey. \ud83d\ude80 \n\nToday's Lesson: \"Calculate Your REAL Hourly Wage\" \u23f1\ud83d\udcb8 \n\nEver wondered if you're making the most of your time and money? It's time to dive deep into what your job truly costs you. Sure, you might think that paycheck is all yours, but wait, there's more beneath the surface! \ud83d\udca1 \n\n\ud83d\udd0d Businesses get it; there's income and then there's profit. Most of us overestimate how much money we have to spend, and it leads to some common financial pitfalls: \n\n\u2705 Making impulse purchases because we think they're just \"a few hours of work.\"\n \u2705 Staying in a job we dislike because it \"pays well\" without considering the hidden costs. \n\u2705 Passing on our dream job because it \"pays less,\" even if it could make us richer in the long run. \n\nHere's how to calculate your REAL hourly wage: \n\n**Step 1:** Add up all the hours it takes to earn that paycheck. Include your \"unpaid\" work hours, commute, and those sneaky \"phantom\" hours spent stressing about work.\n\n **Step 2:** Factor in the costs that go into earning your paycheck. Think beyond the basics, including commuting, work-specific expenses, and even things you buy to cope with stress. \n\nLet's say in our example you thought you were earning $37.50 per hour, but when you consider all the hidden costs, your REAL hourly wage might be much lower, like $19.09. \ud83d\ude31 \n\nUnderstanding the true value of your time and income is a game-changer on your journey to financial freedom. Stay tuned for more eye-opening money lessons to level up your wealth game!\n\n \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcaa Ready to keep learning?

Remember Enron? Yeah, not fun.\n\n\u2728 The Secret Sauce: Diversify your investments! Over time, more \"winners\" tend to pop up, and they make up for the occasional \"losers.\"\n\n\ud83d\udeab Caveat #2: The biggie! You gotta leave your money in the game for the entire ride. If you bail when things get bumpy and dive back in when the market's high, you're just digging your own financial hole. \ud83d\udd73\n\nTime isn't just money; it's your golden ticket to safer investments.

culture.\n\nGrowing up in the 90s and early 00s really did a number on the perception I have of my self image.\n\nI know I'm not the only one who remembers those articles shaming Jessica Simpson, Kelly Clarkson and Britney Spears for being \"less than\" when they looked hot as hell, and the Kate Moss slogan: Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.\n\nIt's a problem I really began to notice as I got older and looked back on photos where I thought I looked horrible, only to see a cute girl owning her sh*t staring back at me.\n\nI'd have anxiety around wearing form fitting clothes, because heaven forbid a had a bump where MY ORGANS WERE on my stomach. And even though I went back to my pre-pregnancy size after having my two kids, I still found myself struggling to buy clothes that actually fit.\n\nIt's like my brain knew what size I was, but I thought I was being deceived.\n\nFinancial dysmorphia works in a similar way.\n\nFor me, it caused anxiety around \"having enough\", even when I had a good job, a stacked emergency fund, and money in the bank.\n\nIt made it hard to spend money, and when I did spend money, I had a lot of anxiety over it (even when it was things I needed). \n\nI did a complete 180 from my early 20s where I spent frivilously on anything and everything, because I was trying to \"change my life\" and \"do better\". Part of this involved budgeting meticulously, where I accounted for every dollar I was going to spend, and mercilessly shamed myself for any \"mistakes\".\n\nOn paper I was changing my habits - I was saving more than I was spending, I was planning for my goals... but I had this pervasive feeling of never having enough.\n\nWhat I didn't realize is that by not taking a balanced approach to my finances, healing my relationship with money, and changing my money mindset, I was able to save more in the short term, but deep down I knew that what I was doing wasn't sustainable and believed I would eventually \"binge\", undoing all my \"hard work\".\n\nContinued in the comments \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47", "total_engagement": 96, "engagement_rate": 0.0010444659623774655, "network_type":

They know that when they can make more money from their investments than they pay in interest on their mortgage, they're in the money-making zone. \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcc8\n\nSo why not pay off that house in cash, you might ask?

Good girl syndrome is keeping you broke. I was so guilty of this - basically good girl syndrome is when women internalize cultural messages about how we ~should~ behave. Like being agreeable, sweet, not too \"much\". \n\nThis can stop you from negotiating your pay, which means you can lose out on over half a million dollars in earnings by age 60 (over $1M if you had invested it).\n\nIt can stop you from setting boundaries around your money, like how you're always loaning it out and never getting it back, or even things like standing up for yourself when you're overcharged. \n\n2. The biggest killer of wealth in your 20s and 30s is something called lifestyle inflation - this is when you only increase your lifestyle and not your savings or investments as you make more. You end up having more things, but no more wealth or freedom - and if you've bought those things with debt, you've already sold those hours of your life before you've even lived them.\n\n3. If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die. Investing isn't a nice to have, it's a must have. It's not for the rich, it's how you get rich. If you only ever trade your time for money there will be a limit to what you can make and you will never stop working.

I asked our female senior VP to have lunch with me so I could network because I knew climbing the ranks to make the big bucks was all about who you know. \n\nI always aspired to have the corner office and the fancy title, but during that lunch she told me: \"I have two boys, and they don't know who I am. My husband has to regularly remind them that I'm never home because I have to work hard for all the nice things we have\". \n\nThat's when I realized the only people who will remember I worked late 20 years from now would be my kids. That's when I realized I didn't want the exec position if it meant not having a life outside of work. \n\nLesson 1: More money doesn't mean anything if you don't own your time. What good is a Rolex if it just tells you when your lunch break is over? \n\nSo I found a way to make more money for every hour of my life I was trading by selling real estate. I figured if I worked harder, at least I could make more money instead of the company just making more. \n\nThe next moment came when my mentor was teaching me about real estate investing. His family immigrated here when he was young, and built an empire. His brother took a page out of his parents book, and invested in a triplex. \n\nHe'd live in one unit, rent out the others, and renovated them over the years. He sold that property for a million dollar profit, and moved to Bali to retire in his 30s. \n\nThis taught me lesson 2 and 3: retirement isn't an age, it's a number in the bank. And the best way to build real wealth is through investing. If you always trade time for money, there will always be a limit to what you can make. \n\n\u2728\ufe0f learn more with our free trainings, or apply to work with me as your 7 figure mentor

in a 401k, you're probably making this huge mistake and it's costing you an insane amount of money. \n\nIn this video I'm going to share with you the secret your employer doesn't want you to know, and what to do instead so you can make more money and retire earlier. \n\nIf you know anyone who is using a 401k you need to send them this video, trust me, you don't want to miss this - it could change your entire life. And who am I to tell you this? I'm a top financial coach, self made millionaire and published author who teaches you the secrets of the rich. \n\nNow a lot of people sign up for a 401k when they start a new job, and they contribute a portion of their paycheck into the account to have it grow so that one day hopefully they can stop working. \n\nWhat your employer doesn't tell you is that the fees on these 401k accounts are astronomical, and that the brokerage your money is with takes those fees whether or not you make money. \n\nMaybe you're thinking, Nicole - aren't they only 1-2%? That seems small. And you aren't wrong, they do seem small - but that's how they get you. Investing $350 a month into your 401k from the age of 25 with a 2% fee means you could retire with just over $1M. Not bad, right? You can do better.\n\n If instead you invested this money on your own, into something like index funds inside a Roth IRA, you could have over $1.8M. At $1.8M you'd have $72k a year in retirement income, versus just $40k a year with thr 401k. \n\nThat's over $750,000 difference total, and over $32k a year. And where did this money go? \n\nTo the brokerage managing your 401k, who spends about an hour a year on your portfolio. \n\n1 hour a year over 40 years means you're paying over $18k an hour. Yes, it really is that high. \n\nCaveat is if your company offers a match- then invest in the 401k only to get the match, then continue investing on your own outside of the 401k. You'll make more. \n\n\u2728\ufe0f learn how to win with money with our free trainings, or apply to work with me as your 7 figure mentor \u2728\ufe0f", "total_engagement": 248, "engagement_rate": 0.002698203736141786, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-10-28T19:32:53.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "secret", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "video", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "mistake", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "anyone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "employer", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "amount", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "coach", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132409511040, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-30T18:18:43.864Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-30T18:18:43.864Z"}, {"id": 607775132409511039, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-810101041", "created_at": "2023-10-30T18:18:43.852Z", "updated_at": "2023-10-30T18:18:43.852Z"}, {"id": 607775132411812578, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-10-31T07:55:11.573Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-23T18:40:37.535Z"}, {"id": 607775132411812579, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-10-31T07:55:11.584Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-23T18:40:37.549Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175319404653, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Cy9L86mScF0/", "post_id": "3223785472866763124", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/29cad3ee4f745ea90dbe0360e7499547.JPEG", "phash": "bcc1c3b5d10fcb14", "image_entities": [{"entity": "black hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9073067307472229}, {"entity": "beauty", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8851431608200073}, {"entity": "black hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.876950740814209}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.84395831823349}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8348672389984131}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6578273773193359}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6521833539009094}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5727494359016418}, {"entity": "hairstyle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4906574785709381}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4823513627052307}, {"entity": "long hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.32945334911346436}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2784937620162964}, {"entity": "smile", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2712221145629883}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9140371680259705}, {"entity": "blouse", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6664549708366394}, {"entity": "sweater", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.43196582794189453}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4273839294910431}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.23405511677265167}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-10-31T02:46:14.060Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T15:34:12.388Z"}}], "post_text": "BABES!

Here\u2019s the thing - we can\u2019t go back in time, but we can create a different future for ourselves.\n\nSomething is always better than nothing- things don't need to be black and white, there are shades of gray.\n\nMaybe $100 a month doesn't get you to your goal, but it means options. I'd rather have $200k than $0.\n\nAlso remember that your current circumstances are your starting point. If you identify a problem, you have the capacity to start working towards changing it. Maybe that means increasing your skill set so you can get  a promotion or raise, maybe that means starting a side hustle, or finding ways to reduce expenses in a meaningful way.\n\nThe best way to make sure you don't get where you want to go is to not take action, challenges are opportunities to learn and try again with new information \n\n \u2764\ufe0f I'm here to help you find a new path and

its just the middle class who's struggling. \n\nBut that's actually not the case - and it's not because they don't have the funds to be okay, they're 1% income earners, they have enough money to get through life. \n\nIt's because contrary to popular belief wealth isn't based on your salary - it doesn't matter how much money you make, if you don't learn the difference between an asset and a liability, or how to manage, save, and grow your money, you will keep living paycheck to paycheck just on a larger scale. \n\nContrary to popular belief, more money won't solve your problems until you learn how to manage more money. \n\nIf you want to learn how to save more without giving up what you love, make more without working harder, and grow your wealth to get paid while you sleep - I'm your girl. \n\nLink in bio for more.", "total_engagement": 169, "engagement_rate": 0.00183869528793533, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-05T20:32:27.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "class", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "funds", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "income earners", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "times", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "girl", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "wealth", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132441756196, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-11T05:03:31.563Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-11T05:03:31.563Z"}, {"id": 607775132441756195, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "1435173693", "created_at": "2023-11-11T05:03:31.557Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-11T05:03:31.557Z"}, {"id": 607775132442449200, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-11T15:29:13.220Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-23T18:40:37.805Z"}, {"id": 607775132442449201, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-11-11T15:29:13.227Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-23T18:40:37.812Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175330557105, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CzUQfRRsPcY/", "post_id": "3230279350329866008", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/29f9c9cbc95bb83ed4b293028780e7bb.JPEG", "phash": "a7daf9dfa0d0c044", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beauty", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.9798224568367004}, {"entity": "black hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8588278889656067}, {"entity": "cheek", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7766602635383606}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7672873139381409}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7650488615036011}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7363764643669128}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.661583423614502}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6179778575897217}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5596888661384583}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.49572834372520447}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.33694976568222046}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2517615854740143}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24658194184303284}, {"entity": "lipstick", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20422187447547913}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8109080195426941}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.658037006855011}, {"entity": "blouse", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6317176818847656}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2607627809047699}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-11-09T01:22:29.101Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T15:38:13.333Z"}}], "post_text": "I'm a self made millionaire, here is advice I'd give to my younger self. \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 \n\n1. as a teenager: stop throwing away the money you're making at your part time job. even if you save and invest $100 a paycheck starting from the age of 15, by 30 you could have over $88,000. \n\nEven if you never saved another dollar, that money could grow to over $1M at 55, allowing you to never stress about retirement, and giving you the ability to retire early. you would have only put in $50k of your own money, meaning you got over 950k for free just by putting your cash in the right places. \n\nStarting young makes setting yourself up for a lifetime of success SO much easier. \n\n2. you have infinite possibilities available to you, but continuing to do the same shit expecting something different is the definition of insanity. If you want change you have to become the change. \n\n3. Your 20s are tough. you're going to want a lot of things, and you might even consider making bad financial decisions to get them sooner. like going into debt for a brand new car, going into debt for a wedding you can't afford, or overextending yourself to buy a house that you fall emotionally attached to. don't do it, it's a trap. \n\nThe wealthy don't spend tomorrow's dollar to live lavishly today, they buy assets that provide them with cash flow and then they use that cash flow to buy the things they want. \n\n4. time is your most valuable asset, you can always get more money but you can't get more time. find ways to stop using your time to buy your money, and learn how to use your money to buy your time so you can really be free. Happiness isn't the presence of things, it's the presence of choice and freedom. \n\nKeep learning with our free trainings or apply to work with me as your 7 figure mentor \u2728\ufe0f", "total_engagement": 185, "engagement_rate": 0.0020127729483315746, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-06T19:36:55.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "happiness", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "teenager", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "job", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "advice", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "self", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "wealthy", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "millionaire", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132441756200, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-11T05:03:31.772Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-11T05:03:31.772Z"}, {"id": 607775132441756199, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-773891688", "created_at": "2023-11-11T05:03:31.767Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-11T05:03:31.767Z"}, {"id": 607775132442449202, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-11T15:29:13.248Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-23T18:40:37.834Z"}, {"id": 607775132442449203, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-11-11T15:29:13.254Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-23T18:40:37.841Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175330557104, "is_sponsored": true, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/CzWu3LwPYJd/", "post_id": "3230975885016138333", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/cebdb29c082926e2b05844742aa57eeb.JPEG", "phash": "ce9081fee22d7a15", "image_entities": [{"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7636030316352844}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5691218376159668}, {"entity": "driving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.49112582206726074}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.46727725863456726}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4581263065338135}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.37456709146499634}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3374188542366028}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3003362715244293}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.27925705909729004}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.25850337743759155}, {"entity": "computer monitor", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4590892791748047}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.28589293360710144}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24981915950775146}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-11-09T01:21:49.877Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-18T15:37:47.104Z"}}], "post_text": "\ud83c\udf1f Let's chat about the rich and how they play the money game like pros, without breaking a sweat! \ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nInstead of grinding away for every dime, they turn their moolah into a cash-printing machine. \ud83d\udcb8\ud83d\udcb5 \n\nThey know that money works harder when invested in income-producing assets.

wallet much, much fatter\n\n1. Stopped caring if people like me\n\nI suffered from good girl syndrome for too long, and it kept me underpaid and taken advantage of.\n\n2. Stopped talking about taking action and just got shit done \n\nThe best way to ensure you never get what you want is to never make a move. It doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to be done.\n\n3. Started failing forwards \n\nI was so scared of failure until I realized failure is a normal part of the cycle, it's just a stepping stone on your roadmap to success. Embrace it, learn from it, and try again.\n\n4. Stopped reading between the lines, if it hasn't been said out loud I'm not addressing it \n\n5. Spent money to benefit my future self before my current self \n\nYou know that feeling when you find a $20 in an old jacket? Imagine what it feels like to open up your bank account and see enough money for a down payment on your dream house. Pay your future self first.\n\n6. Killed my pride, I'm not above doing what needs to be done to hit my goals even if I'm \"cringe\" for doing it \n\n7. Learned what matters to me as an individual and started ruthlessly saying no to everything else \n\n8. Realized that no one cares like you think they do.\n\nIf you're buying nice shit to impress other people, did you realize that they're not even thinking about how cool you look with your car or clothes, they're just thinking about what THEY could look like with it?\n\n9. Understood that not getting what I want is a blessing \n\nEverytime I though shit was falling apart, it was really just falling together in a different and better way.\n\n10. Debunked thoughts and beliefs that didn't serve me.\n\nThinking I had to work hard to make money kept me working hard to make money\n\nIf you're ready to enter your rich girl era, apply to work with me and learn the strategies I used to go from $40k debt to a millionaire at 30. \n\nApplications are on our website under \"Work with Nicole\". \u2728\ufe0f Let's get you wealthy and paid \ud83e\udd0d", "total_engagement": 226, "engagement_rate": 0.0024588469530969505, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-13T16:36:05.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "advantage", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "wallet", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "failure", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "way", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thoughts", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "shit", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "action", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "things", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "people", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132473748256, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-24T08:42:44.788Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-24T08:42:44.788Z"}, {"id": 607775132473748254, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "648548063", "created_at": "2023-11-24T08:42:44.471Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-24T08:42:44.471Z"}, {"id": 607775132474980288, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-24T18:45:32.956Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-30T22:05:32.697Z"}, {"id": 607775132474980289, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-11-24T18:45:32.962Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-30T22:05:32.703Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175343032593, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Czo2ipYpaDX/", "post_id": "3236076207676432599", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/9458e8e1337075b2a1920827863d46c1.JPEG", "phash": "aff0c06d275358a5", "image_entities": [{"entity": "cheek", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8900325894355774}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7884610891342163}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7697217464447021}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.7654399275779724}, {"entity": "lipstick", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.501162052154541}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4585159122943878}, {"entity": "mouth", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.41424867510795593}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4027065932750702}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2636902928352356}, {"entity": "clock tower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.931692898273468}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8421769738197327}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8280612230300903}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5979650020599365}, {"entity": "clock", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5791681408882141}, {"entity": "clothing", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.499610960483551}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2228410542011261}, {"entity": "doll", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2092258632183075}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-11-21T02:02:31.481Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-17T19:24:54.798Z"}}], "post_text": "\ud83d\udeab Stop the Scroll! \ud83d\udeab\n\n\"Girl math\" might be getting laughs, but there's wisdom in it! Ever heard of \"cost per use\"? It's a game-changer for making savvy purchase decisions.\n\nHere's the lowdown: \n\n1\ufe0f. Consider the life hours traded for an item.\n2\ufe0f. Calculate the cost each time you use it.\n3\ufe0f. Measure the happiness or fun per dollar spent.\n\nThis strategy helped me skyrocket from $40k debt to a millionaire at 30. Let's break it down with a pool example:\n\nThinking of a $50,000 pool? If I earned $50/hr, it'd devour 1,000 hours of work! Plus, in Canada, enjoying it's limited to a few months, 60 swims a year, totaling $84 per swim. Is it worth it?\n\nInstead, what about $5k/year on family vacations for a decade? That's 112 hours of fun annually at $44/hour \u2013 a better deal!\n\nLearning this method makes tough choices clearer. Dive into our free financial trainings or join me as your 7-figure mentor.

A student shared her plan to invest in a property, but upon closer inspection, I spotted major red flags that her agent hadn't pointed out. High maintenance fees, potential legal issues, and a long time on the market were just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nWhat bothered me most? The lack of due diligence by her agent. Not understanding the property's true value or ensuring it aligned with the condo laws is a recipe for financial disaster.\n\nEver heard of \"fiduciary duty\"? It's crucial. The seller's agent doesn't owe buyers the same loyalty they give to the seller. That means critical details might slip through the cracks - and her agent was relying on the seller for important information they should have been looking into themselves.\n\nWorse yet, her agent didn't advise on a value range for the offer. Overpaying spells trouble; the bank won't cover more than the property's worth. That gap falls on the buyer, potentially costing a fortune.\n\nYour agent should be more than a transaction broker. They're your guide, protector, and advocate. Whether it's your dream home or an investment property, choose wisely. Don't settle for someone who's in it for a quick commission. Your financial future depends on it.\n\nRemember, the success of your home purchase often hinges on the competence and integrity of your real estate agent.

with the third one being the quickest and easiest way to get rich.\n\nWhen people don\u2019t understand how money works, they think that the average millionaire must have worked for, earned, and then saved a million dollars to reach that elusive 7 figure net worth - but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nIf the average annual wage in the US is $59,428 a year, With an average annual tax rate of 24.8% - meaning $14, 738.14 per year in taxes, and the average annual living expenses for a single person is $38,266 per year...\n\nThis would leave $6,424 a year to save, meaning you\u2019d need to save for over 155 years to become a millionaire with this strategy. That\u2019s a no go for me.\n\nSo if putting your money into a regular savings account isn\u2019t going to get you there, what about buying CDs (certificates of deposit)?\n\nRight now they\u2019re offering about 5% completely risk free - and I\u2019m seeing a lot of people start piling their money in thinking it\u2019s the best option.\n\nBut is it?\n\nIf we took that same $6,424 a year and invested it into CDs, it would take 45 years to grow that money into a million dollars.\n\nAnd that\u2019s using the current 5% rate, which is much higher than the average of 1.38% a year. If we used the average return, it would take 60 years just to get to half a million dollars.\n\nNow there\u2019s a third option, and it is the quickest and easiest way to become a millionaire - and that is through investing into the stock market. \n\nI have a free training to help you learn more.\n\nIf you invested that same $6,424 a year into the stock market, using the average historical annual return of 10%, it would only take you 30 years to become a millionaire.\n\nThe best part is if you invested this money into a Roth IRA, or TFSA in Canada, this entire million dollars and $863,000 of compound interest would be tax free.\n\nTake our free investing masterclass to learn more or apply to work with me as your 7 figure mentor, link in bio.", "total_engagement": 119,

If it\u2019s in the negative that\u2019s okay - the younger you are the lower this typically is. \n\nWe\u2019re not looking for a massive number today, we\u2019re looking for a growing number over time - and investing is the best way to keep this number growing without doing any more work. \n\nLearn the strategies to building a bank account that grows while you sleep, start with our free money trainings or apply to work with me. \n\nMore information on our website \ud83d\udcb8\u2764\ufe0f", "total_engagement": 81, "engagement_rate": 0.0008812681557559866, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-11-17T20:34:49.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "measure", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "someone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "friends", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132473748275, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-24T08:42:46.476Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-24T08:42:46.476Z"}, {"id": 607775132473748274, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1339894117", "created_at": "2023-11-24T08:42:46.428Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-24T08:42:46.428Z"}, {"id": 607775132474980298, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-11-24T18:45:33.066Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-30T22:05:32.987Z"}, {"id": 607775132474980299, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-11-24T18:45:33.070Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-30T22:05:32.997Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175343032589, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Czy73KPPRiZ/", "post_id": "3238914357341264025", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/165a99aee5ce0e26d8f5ff3d58413b0b.JPEG", "phash": "bcd0879d68b4322f", "image_entities": [{"entity": "belt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8274577856063843}, {"entity": "cool", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5782692432403564}, {"entity": "car seat", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5643389225006104}, {"entity": "driving", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5576127767562866}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.49449416995048523}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4054909944534302}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3025023639202118}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.297799676656723}, {"entity": "headrest", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2848707437515259}, {"entity": "vehicle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23356735706329346}, {"entity": "seat belt", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2185625284910202}, {"entity": "baseball cap", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8283769488334656}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7577921748161316}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.41769182682037354}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3835367262363434}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3105867803096771}, {"entity": "glove", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.30905622243881226}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24758924543857574}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.22967979311943054}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-11-21T02:02:31.978Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-17T19:23:18.819Z"}}], "post_text": "Ever wondered how to have your cake and eat it too? \ud83c\udf70 \n\nLet's talk about Coast FIRE \u2013 the pathway to securing your future earlier, granting you both money and freedom today! \n\nCoast FIRE is the golden ticket to securing your financial freedom in the future by front loading your investments today.

I would still go to university, even though I graduated with 40k in student debt. That said, I have my business degree, and I don't think all degrees are created equal in terms of return on investment. \n\nIf you're paying 60k for a degree that you can't use to get a job, you've just bought yourself a very expensive hobby. \n\nAlways consider how long it will take you to work to repay the money you've spent on getting it. \n\n2. I made $150k on my first flip, but if I could go back, instead I'd prioritize buying a multi family home. \n\nI'd live in one unit and rent out the others, update the home, then cash out refinance the home, pull out some of my equity, keep that one rented out, and do it again. \n\nI'd build up two or three properties that way before I bought my dream home. \n\n3. I would have left Ontario sooner. \n\nLast year I moved away from Ontario due to the high cost of living and congestion, and it's been the best decision for my happiness and mental health. I felt like I had to stay there because that's where my \"life was\", but I now realize home is where you make it. \n\nI'm living 100x better for less money. where you live has a huge impact on your ability to save and invest - ask yourself what's more important to you. \n\nWant to learn how to win with money?

However, that's only part of the battle. \n\nGetting the job is not the end, it's a means to the end - but many people don't realize this. They get the job, they get the 6 figure salary, and then they increase their lifestyle to a point where they're financially no further ahead than if they didn't get the \"fancy job\". \n\nActually, they're probably further behind because of the student loans. And the crazy thing is, the people making $60,000 a year could easily be more financially stable just by following a few simple principles: \n\n1. live on less than you make \n2. invest early and often \n3. buy what brings you to a feeling of enough, and not more \n\nImagine making $100,000 a year, but with your spending habits you go through all of it. Then imagine making $60k, living off of $50k, and investing the $10k a year. \n\nIn 30 years this person would have $1.7m in investments, whereas the 100k earner has nothing. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of stories of everyday people making average salaries retiring in their 30s and 40s (Google the fire community to find out more). \n\nThe standard path we've been told is the norm has you stuck on the treadmill, spending every dollar you trade hours of your life for, and sometimes even spending your future life (through the use of debt). \n\nif you never save or invest your money, each year you work, you're no further ahead. \n\nThis is why I say you can be broke making $100k (I've seen it thousands of times) and rich making $60k (also seen this thousands of times). it's ALL about what you do with it. \n\nLearn the strategies to winning with money + building a fat bank account with our free trainings, or apply to work with me as your 7 figure mentor.

the average American income was $4,800 - in today's dollars that would be about $85k a year. Today in 2023 the average income is only $56k a year, so it falls almost $30k short. \n\nThis means we are working the same hours for a lower quality of living. \n\nAdd in the fact that the average home was roughly 4 years of wages in 1933 (end of the depression), and now it's now closer to 10 years, and people are struggling. \"They call it the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it\". \n\nHere's the harsh truth: the world is a different place today, and that means what worked for our parents isn't going to work for us. \n\nThat's why I started my company, No Budget Babe.

money to pay for them. \n\nThe rich don't do this - instead they become financially free by using their money to buy income producing assets like stocks and real estate, and then using the returns to pay for their lifestyle. \n\nAnd while it's true that you need active income (money you work for) to create passive income, by putting your money in the right places you can create a stream of income

homeownership for various reasons, let's dive into the numbers. \n\nHomeownership comes with unrecoverable costs\u2014 usually around 5% of a home's value annually, covering things like insurance, property taxes, and maintenance. \n\nThese are pure expenses, and money you will not get back. \n\nThe argument that is always made against renting is that you never get any of your rent back (making the entire amount an \"unrecoverable cost\"). \n\nHere's the trick: if you can rent a property for less than this 5% in unrecoverable costs you'd pay to own a home, and invest the difference, you're on a solid financial track. \n\nYes a home may appreciate (the past decade is NOT normal, avg appreciation is closer to the rate of inflation, ie. ~3% annually), but it's not a cash-generating asset; it's a liability because it will never pay you, you will always pay for it. \n\nWhereas your investments in the stock market (the difference you saved) can grow at an average rate of ~10% (using the historical returns of the total market over the last century).\n\n(unless you've purchased with a wealth building strategy like house hacking, your house is simply something you pay for)\n\nAdditionally, owning is not the right situation for every person in every situation - and buying when it doesn't make sense simply because of the cognitive bias \"owning is always better\", can be the reason you lose a lot of money.\n\n(I've worked on the sale of hundreds of homes when I was a Broker, and have seen this firsthand - even in hot housing markets).\n\nWhether you rent or own, there's a path to financial success. \n\nJoin me in learning about money empowerment\u2014explore our free money trainings on my website under FREEBIES, or apply to work with me as your 7 figure

message asking for help after they immediately \"lost\" $50k after investing with an advisor.\n\n*I say \"lost\", because I don't know what she's invested in - if she's diversified properly and investing long term then as long as she doesn't sell the money will come back.\n\nWhat I understood from her messages was that she sold her house and took the profits (210k) and invested in the stock market. her goal was to grow that to 1m in 5 years.\n\nThis would have been basically impossible for her to do.\n\nShe believed that since putting in small amounts of money over a longer time frame like 20 years could make you a millionaire, that she could do it in 5 years with a larger lump sum.\n\n...and her advisor did nothing to educate her, just invested the money.\n\nNot only does it usually take 7-10 years to double your money in the stock market, but it would likely take even longer due to the astronomical fees she's likely paying because of how she's invested.\n\nThis is why I say EVEN IF YOU WORK WITH AN ADVISOR you still need to know how to invest, not understanding is like going to get your car fixed at the mechanic as a young girl. IYKYK.\n\nHere's what she should have been told:\n\n1. time, not money is more important when it comes to investing. you can get rich on $50 a month if you give it enough time, that's why it's important to start now.\n\n2. investing for 5 years or less is extremely risky because the markets are all over the place in the short term, long term is where you make money\n\n3. fees matter more than you think, if the average expected return is 10%, but you're paying 3% in fees, they take those whether or not you make money and you limit your possible growth to 7% at best.\n\nI'm a self made millionaire who teaches you about money.\n\nStart winning with our free trainings \ud83d\udcb8 Find them on our website under FREEBIES \ud83e\udd0d", "total_engagement": 88, "engagement_rate": 0.0009574271321793435, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-12-09T17:38:17.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "message", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "term", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "advisor", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "help", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "millionaire", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132507354913, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-11T03:42:32.715Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-11T03:42:32.715Z"}, {"id": 607775132507354912, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-163195318", "created_at": "2023-12-11T03:42:32.708Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-11T03:42:32.708Z"}, {"id": 607775132507782414, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-11T14:53:15.125Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-07T13:18:08.375Z"}, {"id": 607775132507782415, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-12-11T14:53:15.130Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-07T13:18:08.379Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175366946389, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C0wa9vUPT8Q/", "post_id": "3256221122491662096", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/d639acf7b3fc2191ed795b08adc25e67.JPEG", "phash": "e4d1da326961366e", "image_entities": [{"entity": "grocery store", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6172058582305908}, {"entity": "product", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6122953295707703}, {"entity": "convenience store", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.39542803168296814}, {"entity": "supermarket", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2245631366968155}, {"entity": "sheep", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5060980916023254}, {"entity": "underpants", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2433636635541916}, {"entity": "chandelier", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2426224648952484}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2073759138584137}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-12-21T03:02:10.093Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-12T04:41:28.532Z"}}], "post_text": "\ud83c\udf1f This one mindset hack can save you a ton of money effortlessly. \ud83c\udf1f \n\nLet's dive into something crucial: using your credit card without the cash to cover the purchase.

The beautiful thing about this account is that any money you put into it is tax deductible, meaning you get a write off on your taxes, which reduces how much you have to pay. \n\nIf you open an account before December 31, you will accrue $8000 in contribution room. If you made, for example, $70,000 a year in Ontario, contributing the full $8,000 means you'd bring the amount of money you have to pay in taxes down from $12,847 to $10,475 saving you $2,372 in taxes. \n\nOnce you got that refund, you could put that right into your FHSA to add a couple thousand to your down payment, and get this: that $2,372 would be a deduction on your taxes for 2024 saving you even more money. \n\nThe even better part? Invest that money into the stock market for long term or GICs for short term timelines, and all of the money you make is also tax free. It's like the benefits of the RRSP and TFSA combined. \n\nEven if you don't have the money to contribute right now, I'd still open the account so you can gain the $8,000 contribution room for 2023. \n\nLearn how to win with money and build a fat bank account by starting with our free money trainings.

As we step into 2024, let's break this cycle. \n\nWant something different? Start now. Don't wait for change; make it happen.

It wasn't for lack of effort; it was the lack of a roadmap. That's where our program became her guiding light.\n\nWe dove deep into the nuances of credit management with Brianna, exploring strategies to boost her score effectively. It wasn't just about improving numbers; it was about understanding the habits and actions that impact credit health.\n\nFast forward to now, and the transformation is remarkable! In just two months, Brianna's credit score surged by a whopping 26 points, with an impressive 8-point leap in the latest update!\n\nThis isn't merely about numbers\u2014it's a testament to dedication and the power of knowledge. Brianna's journey showcases the impact of mastering credit management, proving that with the right guidance, anyone can elevate their financial standing.\n\nWith a better credit score that means she can qualify for lower interest rates on things like her mortgage, car loans, and it can even impact your insurance!

It's money that works for me, not the other way around. This income covers my family's expenses and is paving the way for my retirement in my 30s.\n\nRetirement isn't just about an age; it's about reaching a financial milestone where you don't have to work anymore. These investments, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), and Mortgage Investment Corporations (MICs), are my golden tickets.\n\nBut that's not all \u2013 I also own physical real estate and invest in the stock market. Why? Because it's crucial not to put all your money in one asset class, like real estate alone.\n\nDiversification is key in investment. While real estate has its perks, spreading investments across different asset classes hedges against risks. REITs and MICs offer passive income, but it's essential to be cautious.\n\nWhen diving into REITs, understanding the company's stability, the real estate they manage, and their dividend history is crucial. As for MICs, evaluating the fund's strategy, borrower types, loan-to-value ratios, and risk factors is a must to ensure a safe investment strategy.\n\nWe teach our students the importance of a diversified portfolio and a safe investing strategy. Making money is great, but preserving it is even better. Ready to make 2024 your best year yet?

Let's talk about why \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 \n\n\ud83d\udca1 401(k)s often come with high fees and limited investment options. These seemingly small fees can add up to hundreds of thousands, even seven figures, in fees over your lifetime. Shocking, right? \n\nEven a mere 1% difference in fees can translate to a significant reduction in your retirement income, potentially shortening it by a decade. \n\nHere's what I'd suggest: only utilize a 401(k) if your employer matches contributions. \n\nFree money is always a win! \n\nAfter securing the match, consider investing on your own outside the 401(k). A Roth IRA or traditional IRA could be excellent options. \n\nOnce your IRA is maxed out, then think about returning to the 401(k) for further retirement investments. If early retirement is your goal, a standard brokerage account might suit you better due to its flexibility in withdrawals. \n\nSetting up these investment strategies takes about 20 minutes, and then your investments work on autopilot, earning while you sleep. \n\nAs your newest seven-figure mentor, I'm here to guide you through these financial strategies. \n\nReady to take charge of your financial future?

Remember, you can only deduct what's essential for your business operations. \n\nLet's look at an example. \n\n\u270d\ufe0f How it Works for a Writer: As a writer, your business expenses might include research materials, office supplies, or even a portion of your workspace. \n\nHowever, claiming these expenses doesn't mean the government pays you. It reduces your taxable income. \n\nFor instance: \ud83d\udcb0 Someone earning $100,000 yearly, with $5,000 in business expenses, brings down their taxable income to $95,000. They pay taxes on that reduced $95,000 amount, not the initial $100,000. \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **But remember,** that $5,000 isn't free money.

The first secret of the rich is they know everything the lower and middle classes are taught about life and money is a lie designed to keep them broke.\n\nThe average person is told to: \n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Budget and coupon to get ahead \n\ud83d\udcb8 Only buy a house or other assets when the market is hot\n\ud83d\udcb8 Work hard to make money \n\nBut the thing is:\n\n\ud83d\udc40 The rich don't budget \n\ud83d\udc40 They buy houses and assets when the markets are down (when everyone else is scared)\n\ud83d\udc40 And they don't work hard, they have investments that do all the heavy lifting so they can sit back and enjoy life \n\nWhen I started doing the opposite of what I was \"told to do\", that's when I got rich.\n\n2. The rich know that time, not money, is their most valuable asset - because time grows your money while you sleep.\n\nInvest just $45 a week from the age of 20-30, just 10 years out of your entire life, and never invest another dollar, you'll retire a millionaire - with over $900,000 of that account being FREE money.\n\nInvest $100 a week starting at 40 until you're 65, you would have contributed just over $400,000, but your account would only be worth about $530,000. You're saving 10x as much, and walking away with an account worth half.\n\n3. If they want something, like a new car or a house, they don't think of ways to work harder and save for it, instead they use their money to buy the assets that can pay for it.\n\nSo for example:\n\nIf a new vehicle was $500 a month, they'd use their money as a down payment to buy a rental property that provides $500 a month in profit instead of using their money to buy the car.\n\nAt the end of the loan, now they have a car they didn't have to pay for, and they have the asset that spits out $500 a month they can now use to cover a different expense.\n\nI used this strategy to become work optional in my 30s - my investments pay for my mortgage, my car, travel, and anything else I want.\n\nNow I have the things, and I have the time to enjoy the things.\n\nApply to work with me as your 7 figure mentor and learn the strategies to saving and investing tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars \ud83d\udcb8", "total_engagement": 304, "engagement_rate": 0.003307475547528641, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-12-18T19:42:00.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "house", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "everything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "secret", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "classes", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "market", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132589397617, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-27T04:49:50.176Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-27T04:49:50.176Z"}, {"id": 607775132589397616, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "322502002", "created_at": "2023-12-27T04:49:50.173Z", "updated_at": "2023-12-27T04:49:50.173Z"}, {"id": 607775132595972222, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2023-12-28T21:23:55.376Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-18T14:46:32.779Z"}, {"id": 607775132595972223, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2023-12-28T21:23:55.382Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-18T14:46:32.786Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175379914800, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C1C4c47yBAh/", "post_id": "3261417356052140065", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/8505c797dacc9007f4998ffae587f264.JPEG", "phash": "b9c5ac63187067ec", "image_entities": [{"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.8101934194564819}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6990732550621033}, {"entity": "facial expression", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6679053902626038}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6591654419898987}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.637182891368866}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6078293323516846}, {"entity": "selfie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.45745816826820374}, {"entity": "laughing", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.313861608505249}, {"entity": "teeth", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2828400433063507}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.27310502529144287}, {"entity": "smile", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2724613845348358}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5291430950164795}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4724803566932678}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2023-12-26T09:45:02.007Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-12T04:46:30.450Z"}}], "post_text": "How to get rich in 2024\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Ditch the budget, it focuses on restriction and shame - NEITHER are conducive to building wealth.\n\nYou get more of what you focus on, and if you're always focusing on what you DON'T have, you'll stay stuck in lack and scarcity.\n\nA budget is a bandaid approach.

of investing, my bank accounts grow while I sleep. \n\nThis video was in my drafts, the account is actually up over $17K YTD now. \n\nThis is my RRSP (in the US a similar account would be a traditional Roth or 401k). It is just one of my investing accounts, and this $100k will grow to over $1M by the traditional age of retirement - not because I'll continue to contribute to it (at this point I have no plans to), but because compound interest and the market will do the work and heavy lifting for me. \n\nYes - that means I will make hundreds of thousands of dollars of FREE money, just by putting it in the right places. I started investing because I wanted freedom - and I by studying the rich I learned the best way to get there wasn't to work harder, it was to work smarter. \n\nWhile I was working my corporate job it would have taken me months to make this kind of cash, and now because I learned the right places to put my money, I was able to make it while I just lived my life.

It could be linked to something deeper: money trauma. \ud83e\udde0\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 What is the Freeze Trauma Response? Growing up witnessing parents ignoring financial issues or facing constant money struggles can create a freeze response. \n\nWhen faced with financial stress, instead of addressing it, some may freeze, avoiding bills and spending without consideration. Impact on Your Life: This pattern might lead to repeated financial struggles, anxiety, and the inability to confront money problems head-on. It's a cycle that echoes the patterns learned during childhood. Recognizing these patterns is the first step towards breaking the cycle. It's okay to seek support and take small steps towards healing your relationship with money. \ud83d\udcaa\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Journal Prompts to Begin Healing: \n\n1. Generational Money Beliefs: What specific money beliefs or habits did I observe or inherit from my parents or guardians? How have these beliefs influenced my financial decisions and behaviors? \n\n2. Emotional Responses to Finances: Reflect on a time when I felt overwhelmed or anxious about money. What emotions or thoughts come up when facing financial challenges? How do these feelings affect my decision-making process regarding money? \n\n3. Patterns and Triggers: Identify recurring financial patterns or situations where I tend to avoid dealing with money matters. What triggers these avoidance behaviors, and how do they relate to my upbringing or past experiences? \n\n4. Self-Worth and Money: How does my self-worth or sense of identity relate to my financial situation? Do I equate my value as a person with my financial success or failures? How might this influence my behaviors around money? \n\nI teach you how to heal your relationship with money so you can start building a fat bank account.

Paying your debts when they're due. Instead of paying your loan at the due date, if you instead make a half payment every two weeks you'll pay it off earlier and save a ton of money. \n\nYour payments will be applied more often, so less interest can grow, and you'll actually make one additional payment per year, and this can cut months or even years off your loan. \n\n2. Waiting too long to invest Money you save and invest in your 20s is worth twice as much as your 30s due to compound interest. \n\nThe longer you wait, the harder you will have to work. The earlier you start, the more free money you can make with less. Investing $50 a week from 20 until 30, literally 10 years of your entire life for a total of $26,000, and then stopping, never investing another dollar, could have you retire with over $1.2M. \n\nThis is called front loading your investments.\n\n If instead you waited until 40 you'd have to invest $1000 a month for 25 years to get the same amount. \n\n3. Hating money It's popular to hate the idea of having money, but what a lot of people don't understand is that millionaires are closer to becoming homeless than they are to becoming a billionaire. \n\nLet's put this in perspective: a million seconds is 11 days, whereas a billion seconds is 31.5 years. I believe in a maximum wage, but I also understand that money is the baseline to succeeding in our society. \n\nOur ability to live is literally behind a paywall. If you hate money, you will never have more of it. \n\nWe can fight a broken system while still playing the game to win. \n\nSoft launching our new updated ULTIMATE Investing Masterclass \u2728\ufe0f it's absolutely free! \ud83d\udcaf Learn how to start investing, the best investments to make, how to have your money NOW instead of when you're old, sample investing portfolios and so much more.\n\nOnly available for a limited time, grab your spot on our website \ud83e\udd0d", "total_engagement": 570, "engagement_rate": 0.006201516651616203, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-12-27T18:23:40.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "millionaires", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "dollar", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "amount", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "ton", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "interest", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "habits", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132606929613, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-03T06:47:29.540Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-03T06:47:29.540Z"}, {"id": 607775132606929612, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-1289447561", "created_at": "2024-01-03T06:47:29.536Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-03T06:47:29.536Z"}, {"id": 607775132607651126, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-03T22:54:51.021Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-22T13:13:54.237Z"}, {"id": 607775132607651127, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2024-01-03T22:54:51.026Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-22T13:13:54.242Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175388215924, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C1aIJWfL0Fy/", "post_id": "3267960306603606386", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/188becac73772713bed16c855b7d2cd8.JPEG", "phash": "add209b97e89434d", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beard", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.916645884513855}, {"entity": "cheek", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6366856098175049}, {"entity": "chin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6102613806724548}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.49873125553131104}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.49116671085357666}, {"entity": "facial hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4671248197555542}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.44458964467048645}, {"entity": "teeth", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3491620421409607}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3260132968425751}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.30257460474967957}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2370462864637375}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21136538684368134}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.20615313947200775}, {"entity": "mirror", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7216701507568359}, {"entity": "clock tower", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.517105221748352}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.49340811371803284}, {"entity": "doll", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.479463666677475}, {"entity": "clock", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3245927691459656}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.27425360679626465}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2024-01-05T05:29:59.261Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-16T22:44:04.051Z"}}], "post_text": "I know you're tired, I know it feels hard, I know you feel \"stuck\", but here's something you need to know: you're doing better than you're giving yourself credit for.\n\nIt's time to stop comparing ourselves to others and start celebrating our own successes.

But the truth is, everyone deserves financial stability and abundance. \n\n\ud83d\udd11 Money isn't everything, yet it's pivotal for survival and flourishing in our world. Many harbor beliefs that hinder their relationship with money, creating what we call \"money blocks.\" \n\n\ud83e\uddf1 These blocks, often subconscious, limit our ability to attract and manage money. What we believe shapes our thoughts, actions, and consequently, our financial outcomes. \n\n\ud83d\udd04 Instead of solely focusing on financial strategies, start by addressing your mindset and healing your connection with money. This shift in beliefs is where true transformation begins.\n\n \ud83d\udeab I used to believe making money was arduous and required immense effort. This belief subconsciously stopped me from pursuing lucrative opportunities, keeping me stuck in financial strain. \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Recognizing these limiting beliefs is the initial step. Challenge them by seeking contradictory evidence. If you think you're unworthy of money, counteract it with reasons that affirm your worthiness: \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Life isn't about \"earning\" the right to survive; you inherently deserve a fulfilling life, independent of financial status. \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Embrace gratitude for what you have while aspiring for more. Your aspirations don't diminish your current contentment. \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Money amplifies one's character; it doesn't define it. You aim to use your wealth positively, unlike those who misuse it. \n\n\ud83c\udf1f The foundation of financial growth lies in believing you deserve more and acknowledging the possibility of achieving it. \n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Shift your beliefs, transform your thoughts, and watch as your actions pave the way for financial abundance. \n\nLearn the tips, tools and strategies I used to heal my relationship with money and invest to become a millionaire - we have free trainings available to help you start, and applications to work with me as your 7 figure mentor are open \ud83e\udd0d", "total_engagement": 113, "engagement_rate": 0.0012294234765484753, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2023-12-31T18:34:54.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "everyone", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "world", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "everything", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "relationship", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "thoughts", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "truth", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "reasons", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "abundance", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "beliefs", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "stability", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [{"name": "Family & Relationships", "confidence": 0.8499543070793152}], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132606929638, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-03T06:47:30.186Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-03T06:47:30.186Z"}, {"id": 607775132606929637, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-321576363", "created_at": "2024-01-03T06:47:30.182Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-03T06:47:30.182Z"}, {"id": 607775132607651136, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-03T22:54:51.131Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-22T13:13:54.359Z"}, {"id": 607775132607651137, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "5", "created_at": "2024-01-03T22:54:51.135Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-22T13:13:54.363Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175388215919, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C1kO0RnPfK4/", "post_id": "3270804394353750712", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/d8d5c9c54e0334a214e317bbd849473f.JPEG", "phash": "bef0d10be50fc834", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beauty", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6825743317604065}, {"entity": "black hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6709678769111633}, {"entity": "eyebrow", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6340019702911377}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.5854014754295349}, {"entity": "hair", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3457316756248474}, {"entity": "hairstyle", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2912939190864563}, {"entity": "lip", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.28714191913604736}, {"entity": "nose", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2623830735683441}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.21849298477172852}, {"entity": "woman", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8939384818077087}, {"entity": "blouse", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.590280294418335}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5016436576843262}, {"entity": "outerwear", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3109312951564789}, {"entity": "packaged goods", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.24527272582054138}, {"entity": "crib", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2047823816537857}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2024-01-05T05:29:59.152Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-16T22:42:03.809Z"}}], "post_text": "It's 2024.

I went from $50k to millionaire by 30 and now guide others on this transformative journey. \n\n\ud83d\udcca Let's break down the math: assuming you're 25, have $2k credit card debt, and a 24.8% income tax rate. After taxes, that leaves $37,600 to thrive and build wealth. \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Tip 1: Keep fixed expenses (rent, loans, groceries, utilities) under 50-60% of your income. Negotiate to cut costs and redirect more money towards building wealth. \n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Result: $18,800, or $724 bi-weekly, becomes your tool for both fun and wealth creation. \n\n\ud83d\udd11 Pay your future self first! Set up automatic transfers to your goals. WPM Principle: Enjoy life while saving. Save roughly 1/3 for personal spending (~$200 bi-weekly), leaving $524 for growth. \n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Prioritize building an emergency fund before tackling debt. Start with a $1,000 HYSA (High-Yield Savings Account) - $333 bi-weekly gets you there in 6 weeks. Then save 3-6 months' bare expenses. \n\n\ud83d\udcb3 Address credit card debt next. Automate $200 bi-weekly payments; clear it in 6 months with minimal interest. \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Now, with $224 bi-weekly to invest, consider a Roth IRA (US) or TFSA (Canada). Automate $450/month into an index or target date fund, benefitting from tax-free growth.\n\n \ud83d\udcc8 Patience is key. Let your investments grow untouched. This disciplined approach could turn that $450/month into over $1M in 30+ years - tax-free! \n\n\ud83d\udcb8 Once debt's gone and your emergency fund's solid, redirect these funds to new goals or ramp up investments. Every extra dollar invested accelerates your millionaire status. \n\n\ud83c\udf1f Ready to turn your $50k income into financial freedom?

\ud83c\udf4c Get ready for a paradigm shift!\n\nLet me tell you about how challenging societal norms transformed my life, leading me to happiness and unexpected riches.\n\nPicture a room full of monkeys and a tempting bunch of bananas atop a ladder. Whenever a monkey attempts to climb for the bananas, they all receive a spritz of water. Soon enough, they stop each other from climbing to avoid the spray.\n\nNow, the fascinating part: new monkeys replace the originals, unaware of the water consequence. Despite never experiencing the spray, they still prevent any monkey from climbing the ladder.\n\nThis experiment perfectly illustrates how we mindlessly follow societal norms without questioning their purpose. From traditional career paths to societal pressures on weddings and retirement, we often accept these norms without evaluating their true value in our lives.\n\nMy journey took a turn when I studied philosophy, prompting me to question everything. I realized that the ultimate purpose in life is happiness. So, I made radical choices, breaking free from societal pressures.\n\nBy challenging norms, I found happiness and unexpected wealth. I refused to go into debt for my wedding, I rejected the conventional idea of working until retirement age. This shift not only made me happier but also unexpectedly led to financial success.\n\nMy advice? Challenge the status quo, prioritize your happiness, and redefine success on your terms. That's the path to true fulfillment and wealth. \ud83d\udca1\u2728", "total_engagement": 271, "engagement_rate": 0.0029484403729613876, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2024-01-10T17:36:41.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "originals", "entity_type": "WORK_OF_ART", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "life", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "each other", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "spray", "entity_type": "CONSUMER_GOOD", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "purpose", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "happiness", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "water", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "room", "entity_type": "LOCATION", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "weddings", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "journey", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bananas", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "bunch", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "shift", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "experiment", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132613288223, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-14T20:47:27.781Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T20:47:27.781Z"}, {"id": 607775132613288221, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "101553375", "created_at": "2024-01-14T20:47:27.778Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T20:47:27.778Z"}, {"id": 607775132615059830, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-15T16:09:55.215Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-29T13:35:55.209Z"}, {"id": 607775132615059831, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "2", "created_at": "2024-01-15T16:09:55.222Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-29T13:35:55.214Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175389935720, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C194Y9HsOhs/", "post_id": "3278024109294938220", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/d155e5059cbdfdadaa4ed868e424db3a.JPEG", "phash": "e9d01687ce29f436", "image_entities": [{"entity": "arm", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.6533608436584473}, {"entity": "eyewear", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.49610912799835205}, {"entity": "glasses", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.4949636459350586}, {"entity": "human", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.37340378761291504}, {"entity": "shoulder", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24205629527568817}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.23654557764530182}, {"entity": "glasses", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.9814537763595581}, {"entity": "headphones", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.8590546250343323}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.7600829601287842}, {"entity": "top", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5581853985786438}, {"entity": "laptop", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4684723913669586}, {"entity": "computer keyboard", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.4463443458080292}, {"entity": "piano", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.3707159459590912}, {"entity": "computer keyboard", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.35564979910850525}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2024-01-17T02:34:34.450Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-27T23:54:46.246Z"}}], "post_text": "CALLING ALL ASPIRING RICH GIRLS \u2728\ufe0f \n\nDid you know that 7 year old you.. \n\n(the one that believed in the tooth fairy \ud83e\uddda\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)\n\nCreated the set of rules and beliefs you use to run your finances today.

Why not you? \n\nSign up to be considered for a spot in our 3 month program to completely overhaul your money and build you a fat bank account that never stops growing. \n\nLink in bio to apply.", "total_engagement": 151, "engagement_rate": 0.0016428579199895554, "network_type": "instagram", "published_at": "2024-01-11T16:37:17.000Z", "brands": {"text_brands": [], "image_brands": []}, "text_entities": [{"entity": "pjs", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "tooth fairy", "entity_type": "EVENT", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "captain", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rules", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "one", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "beliefs", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "cost", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "yep", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "money", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "process", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "set", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "rich girls", "entity_type": "PERSON", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}, {"entity": "approach", "entity_type": "OTHER", "model_name": "BERT", "salience_score": 0.10000000149011612}], "hashtags": [], "mentions": [], "categories": [], "post_properties": [{"id": 607775132613288225, "metric": "post_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-14T20:47:27.865Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T20:47:27.865Z"}, {"id": 607775132613288224, "metric": "post_text_hash", "value": "-132920019", "created_at": "2024-01-14T20:47:27.862Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-14T20:47:27.862Z"}, {"id": 607775132615059832, "metric": "fts_processed_text_version", "value": "1", "created_at": "2024-01-15T16:09:55.243Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-29T13:35:55.231Z"}, {"id": 607775132615059833, "metric": "fts_processed_image_entities_versions_sum", "value": "2", "created_at": "2024-01-15T16:09:55.249Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-29T13:35:55.234Z"}]}, {"social_post_id": 607792175389935707, "is_sponsored": false, "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C2AkIyYLUpo/", "post_id": "3278779462248647272", "program_id": null, "location": {"city_name": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}, "media": [{"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/linqia-discovery-images/4e83466bf5dc2129416acc17fe508201.JPEG", "phash": "e0f19e66e3591c62", "image_entities": [{"entity": "beanie", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.511676549911499}, {"entity": "cap", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.45503151416778564}, {"entity": "face", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.3986527621746063}, {"entity": "forehead", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.24630628526210785}, {"entity": "head", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2413300722837448}, {"entity": "skin", "entity_type": "Label", "confidence": 0.2275988757610321}, {"entity": "baseball cap", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6814945340156555}, {"entity": "computer keyboard", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.6580122113227844}, {"entity": "hat", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.5736326575279236}, {"entity": "computer keyboard", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.2847064733505249}, {"entity": "person", "entity_type": "Object", "confidence": 0.20075589418411255}], "phash_property": {"google_logo_detection_version": null, "google_object_detection_version": null, "google_label_detection_version": null, "google_text_detection_version": null, "custom_logo_detection_version": "3", "custom_object_detection_version": "1", "custom_label_detection_version": "1", "custom_text_detection_version": null, "created_at": "2024-01-17T02:34:12.942Z", "updated_at": "2024-01-27T23:54:02.982Z"}}], "post_text": "Life isn't black and white, there are shades of gray. \n\n\ud83d\udcaa Don't wait for the 'perfect' time. \n\nIf you can't save $500 a month, start with $50. \n\nCan't hit the gym 5 days a week?

interest meant, or that my 2% plus prime interest rate was A LOT more than 2%, or even the impact they'd have on my life paying them back...\n\nI took it a step further and felt like I as an individual was bad with money - I thought I'd never pay off my student loans, I'd never be able to buy a house, I'd always be in a cycle of paying off my credit card debt and wracking it back up, and that I wouldn't hit the life milestones I set out for myself because of it: like getting married or having kids.\n\nThe shame I felt was so immense - I did what I was supposed to do: I went to school, I got the good job, I was making more money than I ever had, but I still didn't have the life that I wanted, and it felt like it was something I'd never have because there was something wrong with me.\n\nWhat I want you to understand is that if you're in this situation right now, know that it is not your fault.\n\nI'm going to repeat that again because I know that little voice in your head is coming up with a million reasons as to why it is.\n\nIt is not your fault.\n\nSo if you didn't have someone to teach you, and you got to this point in life by trusting the institutions that should be held to a standard of care and trust, instead of taking advantage of people when and where they can, it's not your fault.\n\nSo you can drop the shame, and drop the blame.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting though: now that you've recognized the problem and pain that comes from not knowing, it is your responsibility to learn.\n\n1+1 is always going to = 2 no matter how many times you rerun
