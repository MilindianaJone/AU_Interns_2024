This day has been 18 years in the making! 13 years of schoolwork, long hours of studying and accomplishing dreams!\nThere are so many things I want to say! So many things I\u2019m worried I didn\u2019t teach you, I didn\u2019t say to you and should have. I could be here for years, but didn\u2019t I just do that? I have to trust that all the time, energy, stress and tears for the past 18 years has prepared you for your next step in life.\n\nI\u2019m going to be honest, I have been going through the motions for the past few months, trying hard to not even think about this day! I have tried and can\u2019t seem to put all my emotions into words. They\u2019re highs and lows, good and bad, happy and sad all rolled into one! This is, by far, the hardest letter I\u2019ve had to write to you. \n\nFor 18+ years now you\u2019ve been the constant in my life! We\u2019ve cried together, laughed together, experienced life together. Every morning I woke up and you were there; every evening I went to bed, you were there. Today marks the day you end an era and begin a new one. One where you won\u2019t be the constant in my life. One were not only you, but me, have to learn a different normal. Today marks the end of us being attached at the hip and doing every single little thing together.\n\nI can still remember clear as day watching you leave for your first day of kindergarten, with tears in my eyes then! Today, I will watch you walk across that stage, again with tears in my eyes. It is the most bittersweet moment I\u2019ve ever experienced.\n\nProud isn\u2019t a strong enough word to describe how I feel! And maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s so emotional. You are my heart walking around this world, exposed to everyone!\nI know you will go on to do amazing things in life. I know you are ready for this next step because I prepared you for it. But while I was preparing you for life, I didn\u2019t prepare myself. I didn\u2019t think about having to send you out into the giant world, without me! I didn\u2019t think about how hard it was to walk away from you, let you be on your own and for me to sit, without you by me every day.

I don't know if you feel any different today than you did yesterday\u2026. Maybe you should \ud83d\ude02 Today is the day you enter legal adulthood, the day that you can legally vote (please take the responsibility seriously and approach the voting booth well-informed and skeptically optimistic), purchase tobacco products (Yuck), enter binding contracts (Please don't enslave yourself to unnecessary debt), and purchase lottery tickets (You have better, more productive things to do with your money. Trust me).\n\nTurning 18 is a pretty big deal. This isn't your run-of-the-mill birthday. You only turn 18 once, after all. I shouldn't write about the ol\u2019 motherhood cliche, about how I can't believe time passed so quickly, blah, blah, blah\u2026. But it's true. I can't believe how fast the years have flown by, especially when each individual day (especially those early ones) seemed to drag on.  When you were born, I thought I would have forever. As dumb as it sounds, I never saw this day coming. You were supposed to be with me forever, my partner in crime, my shadow. Now you\u2019re this fabulous young woman, living in her own apartment, two states away from me, going to college and cheering on one of the best teams in the nation. I. Am. SO. Proud. Of. YOU. \n\nI know that things haven't always been easy for you and you didn't always get the best version of me. Too many times you got the rundown, terribly exhausted, paper-thin sanity model of a mother. You have done brilliantly well at sharing me the last 6 years and that shouldn\u2019t go unnoticed. You stepped up in ways you shouldn\u2019t have had to, but you did it with such power and tenacity, it makes me know that you\u2019re going to be alright this year away from me.
